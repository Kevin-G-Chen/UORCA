Here's a short poem about birds:

In the sky where the bluebirds fly,  
Wings spread wide, they dance and sigh.  
From vibrant robins to sparrow's cheer,  
Their songs are sweet, for all to hear.

With feathers bright in the sun's warm light,  
They flit and flutter, such a joyful sight.  
In the morning dew, on branches they perch,  
Nature's own choir, in the trees they lurch.

Owl at dusk, with a gaze so wise,  
Watching the world with mysterious eyes.  
Hummingbirds dart, like jewels in flight,  
Bringing magic to day and to night.

In nests of twigs, their young ones stay,  
While parents work hard, both night and day.  
From soaring eagles to the tiny wren,  
The beauty of birds, weâ€™ll cherish again.

So let us admire, both near and afar,  
The wonder of birds, our sky's true stars.  
In every chirp, in every trill,  
Nature's soft music, forever will thrill.
Here's a short poem about jewels:

In a chest of wonders, treasures gleam,  
Jewels whisper softly, like a dream.  
Sapphires blue as the deep, vast sea,  
Emeralds green as the tallest tree.  

Rubies dance like flames in the night,  
Diamonds shine with a brilliant light.  
Amethysts purple, a regal hue,  
Topazes golden, kissed by dew.  

Each gem tells a story, a tale of old,  
Of love and loss, of courage bold.  
Crafted by nature, shaped by hand,  
A twinkle of beauty, forever grand.  

From crown to bracelet, they sparkle and sway,  
Adorning the hearts that cherish their play.  
In every facet, a magic so pure,  
Jewels of the earth, forever endure.
