1,200242839,PD-1 is induced on tumor-associated macrophages in obesity to directly restrain anti-tumor immunity,"Obesity is a leading risk factor for progression and metastasis of many cancers1,2, yet can also promote improved survival for some cancers3-5 and enhance responses to some immune checkpoint blockade therapies6-8. The role of the immune system in the obesity-cancer connection and how obesity influences immunotherapy, however, remain unclear. While PD-1 expression by macrophages has been described9-12, we found that obesity selectively induced PD-1 on macrophages and that PD-1 directly impaired macrophage function. Single cell RNA sequencing of murine colorectal carcinoma tumors showed obesity remodeled myeloid and T cell populations, with fewer clonally expanded effector T cells and increased abundance of PD-1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Cytokines and molecules associated with obesity, including IL-6, leptin, and insulin, and the unsaturated fatty acid palmitate, induced PD-1 expression on macrophages in a glycolysis-dependent manner and that MTORC1 pathway signaling is essential for PD1 expression. PD-1+ TAMs had increased mitochondrial respiration, fatty acid metabolism and cell cylewhile PD-1- TAMs had increased inflammatory signature , phagocytosis and antigen presentation to T cells. These patterns were directly regulated by PD-1, as recombinant PD-L1 reduced macrophage glycolysis, phagocytic capacity and antigen presentation, and this was reversed with blocking PD-1 antibody. Further, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose prevented the increase in CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II that would otherwise occur with anti-PD-1 treatment. Conversely, PD-1-deficient Pdcd1-/- TAMs had high rates of glycolysis, phagocytosis, and expression of MHC-II. Myeloid-specific PD-1 deficiency correlated with slower tumor growth, enhanced TAM antigen presentation capability, and increased CD8 T cell activation together with reduced markers of exhaustion. These findings show metabolic signaling and type 1 inflammatory cues in obesity induces PD-1-mediated suppression of TAM function and reveal a unique macrophage-specific and glycolysis-dependent mechanism to modulate immune tumor surveillance and checkpoint blockade. This may contribute to increased cancer risk yet improved response to PD-1 blockade in TAM-enriched tumors and obesity.",Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,GSE242839,2024/07/19,7.3,8.0,8.0,6.0,"This dataset investigates the role of PD-1 on tumor-associated macrophages in the context of obesity and its implications for anti-tumor immunity.

2,200244104,Targeting DHX9 triggers interferon response and replication stress in Small Cell Lung Cancer [RIP-seq I],"Activating innate immunity in cancer cells through cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing pathways, a phenomenon known as “viral mimicry”, has emerged as an effective strategy to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot”. Through a curated CRISPR-based screen of RNA Helicases, we identified DExD/H-box helicase 9 (DHX9) as a potent repressor of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). Depletion of DHX9 induced accumulation of cytoplasmic dsRNA and triggered tumor-intrinsic innate immunity. Intriguingly, ablating DHX9 also induced aberrant accumulation of R-loops, which resulted in an increase of DNA damage-derived cytoplasmic DNA and replication stress in SCLCs. In vivo, DHX9 deletion promoted decrease in tumor growth while inducing a more immunogenic tumor microenvironment, invigorating responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. These findings suggest that DHX9 is a crucial repressor of tumor-intrinsic innate immunity and replication stress, representing a promising target for SCLC and other “cold” tumors where genomic instability contribute to pathology.",Homo sapiens,GSE244104,2024/02/01,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,"This dataset explores the role of DHX9 in small cell lung cancer, highlighting its impact on tumor immunity and responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade.

3,200202543,Joint single-cell transcriptomics and epigenomics analysis reveal key regulators of CAR T cell stemness and antitumor immunity,"In this study, we revealed the molecular network governing the differentiation of CAR T cells into transcriptionally and epigenetically distinct subsets. Using two mouse cancer models with different sensitivities to CAR T-cell therapy, we showed that CD8+ CAR T cells transitioned from the stem-like to effector-like subset in B-cell ALL but developed into exhausted T cells in the solid tumor. By simultaneously profiling transcriptomic and epigenomic analyses in single cells, we demonstrated that lineage-defining TFs were often controlled by exceptionally high numbers of cis-regulatory elements and regulated distinct chromatin states foreshadowing transcriptional changes during T cell differentiation. Different CAR T-cell subsets were governed by distinct gene regulatory networks with TFs as hubs. We showed that FOXP1 was a hub TF in the stem-like network and promoted the antitumor response and stemness of CAR T cells while limiting their transition to the effector-like subset. In contrast, KLF2, a hub TF in the effector-like network, controlled the lineage choice between effector-like and exhausted subsets by driving the effector program and suppressing the exhaustion program.",Mus musculus,GSE202543,2023/10/09,5.0,5.0,5.0,5.0,"This dataset examines CAR T cell differentiation and antitumor immunity, which is relevant to immunotherapy.

Intra-tumoral heterogeneity, marked by neuroendocrine (NE) and non-neuroendocrine (non-NE) cell states, defines SCLC, but the drivers of SCLC plasticity are poorly understood. To map the landscape of SCLC tumor microenvironment (TME), we apply spatially resolved transcriptomics and quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics to metastatic SCLC tumors obtained via rapid autopsy. The phenotype and overall composition of non-malignant cells in the tumor microenvironment (TME) exhibits substantial variability, closely mirroring the tumor phenotype, suggesting TME-driven reprogramming of NE cell states.

6,200208770,Targeted alveolar regeneration with Frizzled-specific agonists,"Wnt ligands oligomerize Frizzled (Fzd) and Lrp5/6 receptors to control the specification and activity of stem cells in many species. How Wnt is selectively activated in different stem cell populations, often within the same organ, is not understood. In lung alveoli, wherein Wnt-dependent epithelial and stromal progenitors are intermingled, we show that distinct Wnt receptors are expressed by epithelial (Fzd5/6), endothelial (Fzd4), and stromal (Fzd1) cells. Moreover, Fzd5 was uniquely required for alveolar epithelial stem cell activity. However, by developing an expanded repertoire of Fzd-Lrp agonists (FLAgs), we could activate canonical Wnt signaling in alveolar epithelial stem cells via either Fzd5 or, unexpectedly, non-canonical Fzd6. Fzd5 and Fzd6 FLAgs stimulated supra-physiological alveolar epithelial stem cell activity in mice following lung injury, but only Fzd6 FLAg promoted an alveolar fate in airway-derived progenitors.

7,200233097,STAT3 inhibition permits epigenetic reprogramming and TLR9/IRF8-driven differentiation of inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia [RRBS],"Cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells but achieving leukemic cell immunogenicity proved challenging in clinical setting. Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects. These findings support further development of CpG-STAT3 inhibitors as a new bi-functional agents for AML immunotherapy.",Mus musculus,GSE233097,2024/07/23,2.7,2.0,2.0,4.0,"This dataset investigates AML and TLR9 stimulation, which is somewhat related to immunotherapy but does not focus on lung cancer, making it less relevant to the research query.","This dataset focuses on acute myeloid leukemia and its immunogenicity, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy, leading to low relevance.","This dataset studies AML and T cell differentiation, which is somewhat relevant to immunotherapy.

8,200246742,MBNL1 regulates programmed postnatal switching between regenerative and differentiated cardiac states [RIP-seq],"Background: Discovering determinants of cardiomyocyte maturity will be critical to understanding the maintenance of differentiated states and potentially reawakening endogenous regenerative programs in adult mammalian hearts as a therapeutic strategy. Recent evidence has suggested that forced dedifferentiation paired with oncogene expression is sufficient to drive cardiac regeneration. However, elucidation of endogenous developmental determinants of the switch between regenerative and mature cardiomyocyte cell states is necessary for optimal design of regenerative approaches for heart disease. Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) regulates both fibroblast and erythroid differentiation and proliferation. Hence, we examined whether MBNL1 promotes and maintains mature cardiomyocyte states while antagonizing cardiomyocyte proliferation. Methods: MBNL1 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models were studied at several developmental timepoints and in surgical models of heart regeneration. Multi-omics approaches were combined with biochemical, histological, and in vitro genetic work to determine the mechanisms through which MBNL1 exerts its effects. Results: MBNL1 is co-expressed with a maturation-association genetic program in the heart and is regulated by the MEIS1/Calcineurin signaling axis. Targeted MBNL1 overexpression early in development prematurely transitioned cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic growth, hypoplasia, and dysfunction, while loss of MBNL1 function increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and proliferation through altered cell cycle inhibitor transcript stability. Moreover, MBNL1-dependent stabilization of estrogen-related receptor signaling was essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte maturity in adult myocytes. In accordance with these data, modulating MBNL1 dose tuned the temporal window of neonatal cardiac regeneration, where increased MBNL1 expression arrested myocyte proliferation and regeneration, and MBNL1 deletion promoted regenerative states with prolonged myocyte proliferation. However, MBNL1 deletion was not sufficient to promote regeneration in the adult heart due to cell-cycle checkpoint activation. Conclusions: Here, MBNL1 was identified as an essential regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiated states, their developmental switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth, and their regenerative potential through controlling an entire maturation program by stabilizing adult myocyte mRNAs during postnatal development and throughout adulthood. Additionally, MBNL1-dependent perturbations of a myocyte’s preferred growth mechanism at a given developmental state had detrimental consequences to cardiac function, and targeting loss of maturity and removing cell cycle inhibitors was not insufficient to promote adult regeneration.",Rattus norvegicus,GSE246742,2024/03/07,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on cardiac states and regeneration, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in minimal relevance.","This dataset examines cardiac states and regeneration, which is not related to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in minimal relevance.",This dataset focuses on cardiomyocyte states and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

9,200239682,Inhibition of miR-497-5p improves keratinocyte function upon skin exposure to sulfur mustard,"Sulfur mustard (SM) is a hazardous chemical warfare agent. Exposure to SM results in various pathologies including skin lesions and impaired wound healing. To date, there are no effective treatments available. Here we discover that the miRNA miR-497-5p is induced in epidermal cells by SM and mediates keratinocyte dysfunction. Transcriptome analysis using RNA-seq in normal human epidermal keratinocytes (NHEK) revealed that SM evoked differential expression of 1,896 mRNAs and 25 miRNAs with many of these RNAs known to be involved in keratinocyte function and wound healing. We demonstrated that keratinocyte differentiation and proliferation were efficiently regulated by miRNAs induced in skin cells after exposure to SM. The inhibition of miR-497-5p counteracted SM-induced premature differentiation and inhibition of proliferation in NHEK. In addition, we showed that microneedle-mediated transdermal application of lipid-nanoparticles containing miR-497-5p inhibitor improved the healing of human skin biopsies upon exposure to SM.

10,200242051,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment [bulk_RNA-seq_vivo],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE242051,2024/02/02,8.3,9.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset explores the role of NR4a in CD8+ T cell exhaustion and its implications for tumor immunity, directly relating to immunotherapy for lung cancer, making it extremely relevant.","This dataset discusses the role of NR4a in T cell exhaustion and its implications for tumor immunity, which is highly relevant to lung cancer immunotherapy.",This dataset investigates the role of NR4a in T cell exhaustion and its implications for immunotherapy.

12,200270910,Context-dependent roles for autophagy in myeloid cells in tumor progression [Atg5_MC38],"Autophagy is known to suppress tumor initiation by removing genotoxic stresses in normal cells. Conversely, autophagy is also known to support tumor progression by alleviating metabolic stresses in neoplastic cells. Centered on this pro-tumor role of autophagy, there have been many clinical trials to treat cancers through systemic blocking of autophagy. Such systemic inhibition affects both tumor cells and non-tumor cells, and the consequence of blocked autophagy in non-tumor cells in the context of tumor microenvironment is relatively understudied. Here, we examined the effect of autophagy-deficient myeloid cells on the progression of autophagy-competent tumors. We found that blocking autophagy only in myeloid cells modulated tumor progression markedly but such effects were context dependent. In a tumor implantation model, the growth of implanted tumor cells was substantially reduced in mice with autophagy-deficient myeloid cells; T cells infiltrated deeper into the tumors and were responsible for the reduced growth of the implanted tumor cells. In an oncogene-driven tumor induction model, however, tumors grew faster and metastasized more in mice with autophagy-deficient myeloid cells. These data demonstrate that the autophagy status of myeloid cells plays a critical role in tumor progression, promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on the context of tumor-myeloid cell interactions. This study indicates that systemic use of autophagy inhibitors in cancer therapy may have differential effects on rates of tumor progression in patients due to effects on myeloid cells and that this warrants more targeted use of selective autophagy inhibitors in a cancer therapy in a clinical setting.",Mus musculus,GSE270910,2024/07/02,3.3,4.0,2.0,4.0,"This dataset investigates the role of autophagy in myeloid cells in tumor progression, which is relevant to cancer biology but does not specifically address lung cancer or immunotherapy, limiting its relevance.","This dataset examines the role of autophagy in myeloid cells and tumor progression, which is somewhat relevant but does not specifically address lung cancer or immunotherapy.","This dataset studies the role of autophagy in myeloid cells and tumor progression, which has implications for cancer therapy.

16,200271713,PRTN3 suppresses cytotoxic immune-cell activation and antitumoral immunity through proteolytic cleavage of CXCL9 in KRAS mutant lung adenocarcinoma,"The intratumoral activity of chemokine system has important roles in cancer immunotherapy strategies.One of the mechanisms of immune checkpoint blocking (ICB)resistance may be the dysfunction of chemokine signaling. Here, we first report that KRAS mutation in LUAD cells up-regulates the expression of protease 3 (PRTN3), that inhibits cytotoxic immune cell activation in the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting the CXCL9/CXCR3 axis, providing an unconventional mechanism for tumor immune escape. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that PRTN3 was up-regulated by c-Myc transcription and secreted into the tumor microenvironment, where CXCL9 was inactivated by proteolysis, and finally result in inhibiting the activation of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. Meanwhile, samples from LUAD patients with high PRTN3 expression showed low CXCL9 activity. Furthermore, application of a hydrolysis-resistant CXCL9 protein (H-R CXCL9) effectively improves the immunomodulate effect in LUAD patient organoids. Importantly, PRTN3 knockdown increased the susceptibility of KRAS mutant cells to Anti-pd-1 therapy.

17,200247471,Analysis of the transcriptomic profiles for HER2 CD8+ CAR T cells-overexpressed FOXO1WT,"T cell exhaustion and metabolic dysfunction induced by chronic antigen stimulation within the tumor microenvironment represent formidable obstacles in CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors. Previously, we developed a method to convert effector/exhausted CAR T cells that emerge from repeated antigen stimulation into stem cell memory-like CAR T (termed CAR-iTSCM) cells. These CAR-iTSCM cells exhibit expression of early memory markers and enhanced mitochondrial metabolism after quiescence under culture conditions containing IL-7, CXCL12, and the NOTCH-ligand. However, we noticed that this strategy was effective for CD19 CAR used for blood cancers, but not for HER2 CAR commonly used to treat solid tumors, due to tonic CAR signals. In this study, we developed a new culture condition for CAR iTSCM cells suitable for HER2 CAR and elucidated the mechanism of induction of stemness and mitochondrial fitness. We found that short-term resting condition with IL-7, CXCL12, and pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib can induce stem-like CAR T cells at the epigenetic level and enhance mitochondrial metabolism. We identified FOXO1 as a critical regulator in the process of epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, and anti-tumor activity. We found that overexpression of FOXO1 leads to enhanced mitochondrial metabolism, efficient CAR T cell expansion, and potent anti-tumor effects through epigenetic modifications. These findings suggest that regulating the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 is a promising strategy for engineering effective CAR T cells for treating solid tumors. In this analysis, we aimed to investigate the effects of FOXO1WT overexpression on the transcriptomic profiles in 4-1BB-based HER2 CD8+ CAR T cells which exhibit tonic signals-induced exhaustion hallmarks.",Homo sapiens,GSE247471,2023/11/21,7.0,8.0,7.0,6.0,"This dataset focuses on CAR T cell therapy and its implications for solid tumors, including lung cancer, highlighting the importance of metabolic reprogramming in enhancing anti-tumor activity, making it very highly relevant.","This dataset investigates CAR T cell therapy and its implications for solid tumors, including lung cancer, making it highly relevant to the query.","This dataset investigates the metabolic reprogramming of CAR T cells for solid tumors, including lung cancer.

18,200212622,Pulmonary parasite infection: do trypanosomes take your breath away?,"Approximately 20% of sleeping sickness patients exhibit respiratory complications which are commonly attributed to secondary bacterial infections, with an unknown role of the parasite. Using a Glossina morsitans tsetse fly initiated Trypansoma brucei infection in mice we found that parasites rapidly and permanently colonize the lungs, representing one of the major target organs next to the adipose tissue. Trypanosomes were found by immunofluorescence staining and scanning electron microscopy to occupy the extravascular spaces surrounding the blood vessels of the alveoli and bronchi. Parasites were even found in the lung cartilage. Trypanosomes were often observed as nests of multiplying parasites exhibiting close interactions with collagen and highly active secretion of extracellular vesicles that are engaged in intercellular communication. The local immune response was analysed by flow cytometry after 10 and 21 days of infection and was characterized by a substantial increase of CD11b+ Ly6C+ monocytes, CD11b+ Ly6C+ F4/80+ macrophages and CD11b+ CD11c+ dendritic cells. CD11b+ Ly6G+ neutrophils only accumulated prominently at the late infection time point. Interestingly, parasite presence resulted in a significant reduction of B220+ IgM+ B cells, CD11b+ CD11clo/- SiglecF+ eosinophils and TcR-β- NK1.1+ natural killer cells. Digital transcriptomics revealed infection-induced upregulation of Il-10, IFN-ɣ- and IFN-α-responses, IL-2-, IL-6- and TNF-signalling, a Th1 pro-inflammatory signature, negative immune checkpoint regulators and a predominant M1 macrophage polarization. Il12a and genes associated with complement and the B cell receptor were downregulated. No infection-associated pulmonary dysfunction could be detected by in vivo lung function measurements, mirroring the limited pulmonary complications during sleeping sickness. However, the substantial reduction of eosinophils, B cells and NK cells may render individuals more susceptible to opportunistic infections. Collectively, these observations provide essential insights in the peculiar parasite biology, immunological reactions and physiological function of a largely overlooked target organ which may trigger new diagnostic approaches for sleeping sickness.",Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,GSE212622,2022/10/25,2.3,3.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset studies the effects of Trypanosoma brucei infection on lung tissue, which is somewhat related to lung biology but does not focus on lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in lower relevance.","This dataset examines the effects of Trypanosoma brucei infection on lung health, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy, leading to low relevance.","This dataset examines pulmonary parasite infection and its immune response, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Transfer RNA-derived fragments (tRFs) have been implicated in various biological processes in cancer. However, the role of tRFs in the development and progression of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) remains unclear. In the present study, we hypothesized that certain tRFs might become induced during LUAD metastatic progression. In this study, micropapillary and solid component was defined as high-risk, other component was defined as low-risk and adjcent tissue was defined as normal control.

22,200260507,Combined inhibition of MNK signaling and BET proteins reveals TGM2 as a novel vulnerability in melanoma,"Melanoma is the deadliest form of skin cancer. MAPK-targeted therapies (MAPKi) and immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) have shown clinical benefit but are limited by resistance mechanisms that remain poorly defined. MNK1/2 inhibitors (MNKi) have shown promising effects in pre-clinical tumor models, particularly in melanoma. Herein, we find that bromodomain and extra-terminal domain protein inhibitors (BETi) in combination with MNKi reduce the proliferation of melanoma cells, including cells with acquired MAPKi resistance. Transcriptomic and proteomic analyses reveal that tissue transglutaminase TGM2 and inhibition of FAK activation are downstream effectors of this combination. We further demonstrate that TGM2 is overexpressed in MAPKi-resistant melanoma cells and that silencing TGM2 inhibits the proliferation of therapy-resistant melanoma cells.

24,200269239,Mitochondrial respiration in microglia is essential for response to demyelinating injury but not proliferation,"Microglia are necessary for CNS function during development and play roles in aging, Alzheimer’s Disease (AD) and the response to demyelinating injury. Mitochondrial respiratory chain (RC) is necessary for conventional T cell proliferation6 and macrophage-dependent immune responses. However, whether mitochondrial RC is essential for microglia proliferation or function is not known. We conditionally deleted the mitochondrial complex III subunit Rieske Iron-Sulfur Protein (RISP) in the microglia of adult mice to assess the requirement of microglial RC for survival, proliferation, and adult CNS function in vivo. Surprisingly, mitochondrial RC function was not required for survival or proliferation of microglia in vivo. RNA-seq analysis showed that loss of RC function in microglia caused changes in gene expression distinct from aged or disease-associated microglia (DAM). Microglia-specific loss of mitochondrial RC function is not sufficient to induce cognitive decline. Amyloid-β plaque coverage decreased and microglial interaction with Amyloid-β plaques increased in the hippocampus of 5xFAD mice with mitochondrial RC-deficient microglia. Microglia-specific loss of mitochondrial RC function did impair remyelination following an acute, reversible demyelinating event. Thus, mitochondrial respiration in microglia is dispensable for proliferation but is essential to maintain a proper response to CNS demyelinating injury.",Mus musculus,GSE269239,2024/06/10,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset studies mitochondrial respiration in microglia, which is not related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

25,200140779,A mammalian Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2 axis controls the cytoskeleton and confers cellular properties required for alveologenesis,"Alveolar formation increases the surface area for gas-exchange and is key to the physiological function of the lung. Alveolar epithelial cells, myofibroblasts and endothelial cells undergo coordinated morphogenesis to generate epithelial folds (secondary septa) within the saccules to form alveoli. A mechanistic understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. We found that the planar cell polarity (PCP) pathway is required in both alveolar epithelial cells and myofibroblasts for alveologenesis. Our studies uncovered a Wnt5a–Ror2–Vangl2 cascade that endows cellular properties and thus novel mechanisms of alveologenesis. This includes PDGF secretion from alveolar type I and type II cells, cell shape changes of type I cells and migration of myofibroblasts.

26,200242951,Contribution of crosstalk of mesothelial and tumoral epithelial cells in pleural metastasis of lung cancer,"Tumor metastasis commonly affects pleura in advanced lung cancer and is related to poor prognosis, but without systematic investigation on different cell types and their crosstalk at single cell resolution. Here, by integrating 180785 single cells from lung cancer and control samples, the most distinctive transcriptome profiles between tumor and control were revealed in mesothelial cells, which is the predominate cell type of pleura. Four subtypes were divided, including one predominately identified in malignant pleural effusion which was characterized by enriched cancer related pathways (e.g., cell migration) along evolutionary trajectory from normal mesothelial cells. Cancer-associated mesothelial cells exhibited varied interactions with different subtypes of malignant epithelial cells, and multiple ligands/receptors exhibited significant correlation with poor prognosis. Experimentally, mesothelial cells can increase the migration ability of lung cancer cells through co-culturing assay, and EGFR was the only affected gene in cancer cells that exhibited interaction with mesothelial cells and was associated with poor prognosis. Using EGFR antagonist cetuximab prevented the increased invasiveness of lung cancer cells induced by mesothelial cells. Moreover, EPGN-EGFR interaction was supported through spatial distribution analysis, revealing the significant proximity between EPGN+ mesothelial cells and EGFR+ epithelial cells.

27,200265937,Analysis of CD70 wild type or CD70 knock out CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells [RNA-Seq],"CD70 is an attractive target for chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy for the treatment of both solid and liquid malignancies. However, the functionality of CD70-specific CAR T-cells is modest. We optimized a CD70-specific VHH-based CAR (nanoCAR). We evaluated the nanoCARs in clinically relevant models in vitro, using co-cultures of CD70-specific nanoCAR T-cells with malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids, and in vivo using a diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Whereas the nanoCAR T-cells were highly efficient in organoid co-cultures, they showed only modest efficacy in the PDX model. Fratricide was not causing this loss in efficacy but rather CD70 interaction in cis with the nanoCAR, as validated by imaging flowcytometry, induces exhaustion. Knocking out CD70 expression in nanoCAR T-cells using CRISPR/Cas9, resulted in dramatically enhanced functionality in the DLBCL PDX model. Through single-cell transcriptomics, we obtained evidence that CD70 knock out (KO) CD70-specific nanoCAR T-cells were protected from antigen-induced exhaustion. In addition, we were able to demonstrate that WT CD70-specific nanoCAR T-cells already exhibit signs of exhaustion shortly after production. Their gene signature strongly overlapped with gene signatures of exhausted CAR T-cells. On the other hand, the gene signature of KO nanoCAR T-cells overlapped with the gene signature of CAR T-cell infusion products that led to complete responses in chronic lymphatic leukemia patients. Our data show that CARs targeting endogenous T-cell antigens, negatively affect CAR T-cell functionality by inducing an exhausted state, which can be overcome by knocking out the specific target, in this case CD70.",Homo sapiens,GSE265937,2024/06/17,6.7,6.0,7.0,7.0,"This dataset examines CD70-specific CAR T-cells, which are relevant to immunotherapy.

29,200242050,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment [bulk_RNA-seq_vitro],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE242050,2024/02/02,4.7,5.0,3.0,6.0,"This dataset discusses T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment, which is relevant to immunotherapy strategies.

31,200263817,Comparative single-cell analysis reveals IFN-g as a driver of respiratory sequelae post COVID-19,"Post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2 infection (PASC) represents an urgent public health challenge, with its impact resonating in over 60 million individuals globally. While a growing body of evidence suggests that dysregulated immune reactions may be linked with PASC symptoms, most investigations have primarily centered around blood studies, with few focusing on samples derived from post-COVID affected tissues. Further, clinical studies alone often provide correlative insights rather than causation. Thus, it is essential to compare clinical samples with relevant animal models and conduct functional experiments to truly understand the etiology of PASC. In this study, we have made comprehensive comparisons between bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BAL) single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNAseq) data derived from clinical PASC samples and the relevant PASC mouse model. This revealed a strong pro-fibrotic monocyte-derived macrophage response in respiratory PASC (R-PASC) in both humans and mice, and abnormal interactions between pulmonary macrophages and respiratory resident T cells. IFN-g emerged as a key node mediating the immune anomalies in R-PASC.

32,200178289,Chemical Genetics Screen Identifies COPB2 Tool Compounds That Alters ER Stress Response and Induces RTK Dysregulation in Lung Cancer Cells,"Activating mutations in the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) are common driver mutations in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). First, second and third generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are effective at inhibiting mutant EGFR NSCLC, however, acquired resistance is a major issue, leading to disease relapse. Here, we characterize a small molecule, EMI66, an analog of a small molecule which we previously identified to inhibit mutant EGFR signalling via a novel mechanism of action. We show that EMI66 attenuates receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) expression and signalling and alters the electrophoretic mobility of Coatomer Protein Complex Beta 2 (COPB2) protein in mutant EGFR NSCLC cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that EMI66 can alter the subcellular localization of EGFR and COPB2 within the early secretory pathway. Furthermore, we find that COPB2 knockdown reduces the growth of mutant EGFR lung cancer cells, alters the post-translational processing of RTKs, and alters the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress response pathway.

34,200272296,Released Bacterial ATP Shapes Local and Systemic Inflammation during Abdominal Sepsis,"Sepsis causes millions of deaths per year worldwide and is a current global health priority declared by the WHO. Sepsis-related deaths are a result of dysregulated inflammatory immune responses indicating the need to develop strategies to target inflammation. An important mediator of inflammation is extracellular adenosine triphosphate (ATP) that is secreted by inflamed host cells and tissues, and also by bacteria in a strain-specific and growth phase-dependent manner. Here, we investigated the mechanisms by which bacteria release ATP. Using genetic mutant strains of Escherichia coli (E. coli), we demonstrate that ATP release is dependent on ATP synthase within the inner bacterial membrane. In addition, impaired integrity of the outer bacterial membrane and bacterial death notably contribute to ATP release. In a mouse model of abdominal sepsis, local effects of bacterial ATP were analysed using a transformed E. coli bearing an arabinose-inducible periplasmic apyrase hydrolyzing ATP to be released. Abrogating bacterial ATP release shows that bacterial ATP suppresses local immune responses, resulting in reduced neutrophil counts and impaired survival. In addition, bacterial ATP has systemic effects via its transport in outer membrane vesicles (OMV). ATP-loaded OMV are quickly distributed throughout the body and upregulated expression of genes activating degranulation in neutrophils, potentially contributing to the exacerbation of sepsis severity. This study reveals mechanisms of bacterial ATP release and its local and systemic roles in sepsis pathogenesis.",Mus musculus,GSE272296,2024/07/16,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates bacterial ATP in sepsis, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

35,200270259,Pro-efferocytic nanotherapies reduce vascular inflammation without inducing anemia in a large animal model of atherosclerosis,"Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disorder responsible for cardiovascular disease. Reactivation of efferocytosis, the phagocytic removal of cells by macrophages, has emerged as a translational target for atherosclerosis. Systemic blockade of the key ‘don’t-eat-me’ molecule, CD47, triggers the engulfment of apoptotic vascular tissue and potently reduces plaque burden. However, it also induces red blood cell clearance, leading to anemia. To overcome this, we previously developed a macrophage-specific nanotherapy loaded with a chemical inhibitor that promotes efferocytosis. Because it was found to be safe and effective in murine studies, we aimed to advance our nanoparticle into a porcine model of atherosclerosis. Here, we demonstrate that production can be scaled without impairing nanoparticle function. At an early stage of disease, we find our nanotherapy reduces apoptotic cell accumulation and inflammation in the atherosclerotic lesion.

Herein, we report the crucial function of UBXN3B in B lymphopoiesis. In the inducible global knockout and B cell-specific Ubxn3b knockout model, the terminal B cell number is reduced by > 90% in both Ubxn3b-/- mouse models. Transfer of wildtype bone marrows to irradiated global Ubxn3b-/- restores the B population, while reverse transplantation fails to do so. The deficiency begins from the precursor stage. The B population drops rapidly with significant apoptosis, presents a much higher level of pro-caspase-3 protein following induction of Ubxn3b knockout. RNA-sequencing reveals significantly suppressed cell cycle genes while upregulated TP53 signaling in Ubxn3b-/- B cells. Ubxn3b-/- mice are highly vulnerable to respiratory viruses, with increased lung viral loads and immunopathology, reduced B population and virus-specific IgM/IgG.

37,200270740,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [A375],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE270740,2024/07/24,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,"This dataset investigates TNF-induced dedifferentiation in melanoma and its implications for resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors.

38,200268894,Semaphorin 3C (Sema3C) reshapes stromal microenvironment to promote hepatocellular carcinoma progression,"More than 90% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cases develop in the presence of fibrosis or cirrhosis, making the tumor microenvironment (TME) of HCC distinctive due to the intricate interplay between cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and cancer stem cells (CSCs), which collectively regulate HCC progression. However, the mechanisms through which CSCs orchestrate the dynamics of the tumor stroma during HCC development remain elusive. Our study unveils a significant upregulation of Sema3C in fibrotic liver, HCC tissues, peripheral blood of HCC patients, as well as sorafenib-resistant tissues and cells, with its overexpression correlating with the acquisition of stemness properties in HCC. We further identify NRP1 and ITGB1 as pivotal functional receptors of Sema3C, activating downstream AKT/Gli1/c-Myc signaling pathways to bolster HCC self-renewal and tumor initiation. Additionally, HCC cells-derived Sema3C facilitated extracellular matrix (ECM) contraction and collagen deposition in vivo, while also promoting the proliferation and activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs). Mechanistically, Sema3C interacted with NRP1 and ITGB1 in HSCs, activating downstream NF-kB signaling, thereby stimulating the release of IL-6 and upregulating HMGCR expression, consequently enhancing cholesterol synthesis in HSCs. Furthermore, CAF-secreted TGF-β1 activates AP1 signaling to augment Sema3C expression in HCC cells, establishing a positive feedback loop that accelerates HCC progression. Notably, blockade of Sema3C effectively inhibits tumor growth and sensitizes HCC cells to sorafenib in vivo. In sum, our findings spotlight Sema3C as a novel biomarker facilitating the crosstalk between CSCs and stroma during hepatocarcinogenesis, thereby offering a promising avenue for enhancing treatment efficacy and overcoming drug resistance in HCC.",Homo sapiens,GSE268894,2024/07/10,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on hepatocellular carcinoma progression, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

39,200244764,Decipher immune response in early recovery phase of respiratory virus-induced disorder [BAL scRNA-seq],"Appropriate lung repair responses are essential to restore functional integrity and prevent severe disease phenotypes after injury. While macrophages are thought to contribute to repair, whether distinct subsets occupy particular niches and assume dedicated tasks to mediate host recovery post- injury remains unknown. Using an in vivo model of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in combination with single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses, bone marrow chimeras and monocyte fate-mapping, we found the transitional appearance of Ccr2-dependent monocyte-derived Ly6G+ macrophages (Ly6G Macs) after viral clearance. Ly6G Macs inhabited the alveolar spaces of regenerating perilesional areas, exhibited a unique ultrastructural morphology as well as a high metabolic potential. Using in vivo gene targeting and ex vivo wound healing assays, we found that Ly6G Macs could limit disease severity and promote alveolar regeneration via interleukin-4 receptor- and arginase-1-dependent mechanisms acting on type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. We also found evidence that similar macrophages existed in other models of lung injury and in the airways of virally-infected humans. Our study thus identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G Macs as a spatially-restricted short-lived macrophage subset engaging a crosstalk with type 2 alveolar epithelial cells to promote alveolar regeneration and recovery post-injury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target.",Homo sapiens,GSE244764,2024/05/30,7.7,8.0,7.0,8.0,"This dataset examines immune responses in lung injury and recovery, which is relevant to lung cancer immunotherapy.

41,200234974,Pan-cancer mapping of single CD8+ T cell profiles reveals a TCF1:CXCR6 axis regulating CD28 co-stimulation and anti-tumor immunity I,"Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells need to persist and function in diverse tumor microenvironments to exert their effects. Here, we developed Generalizable Matrix Decomposition Framework (GMDF), a matrix factorization algorithm that recovers both shared and tumor type-specific transcriptional programs from diverse data sets, and applied it to a scRNA-seq compendium of 38,852 CD8+ T cells from 141 patients spanning nine different human cancers. Our meta-single-cell analyses uncovered a pan-cancer T cell dysfunction program that was predictive of clinical responses to checkpoint blockade in melanoma and highlighted CXCR6 as a pan-cancer marker of chronically activated T cells. CXCR6 transcription was activated by AP-1 factors and repressed by TCF1. In mouse models, CXCR6 expression increased with tumor progression and upon checkpoint blockade. CXCR6 deletion in CD8+ T cells increased apoptosis of PD1+Tim3+ cells and compromised tumor growth control due to suppressed expression of survival factors and CD28 co-stimulation, revealing a role for CXCR6 in opposing PD1-mediated suppression of CD28 signaling. Our application of GMDF led us to discover a TCF1:CXCR6 axis that counterbalances PD1-mediated suppression of CD8+ cell responses and is essential for effective anti-tumor immunity.",Mus musculus,GSE234974,2024/07/02,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,"This dataset investigates CD8+ T cells and their role in anti-tumor immunity across various cancers, including lung cancer.

We employed supervised clustering to identify a rare group of cells with transcriptional similiarities to embryonic distal lung bud tip progenitors. This approach identified a quiescent progenitor population of airway cells that accounted for all in vitro regenerative activity.

43,200248303,Enrichment and analysis of circular RNA by Induro RT-mediated circRNA sequencing (IMCR-seq),"Circular RNA (circRNA) has recently gained attention for its emerging biological activities, relevance to disease, and potential as biomarkers. Furthermore, the growing prominence of RNA vaccines has brought circRNAs into the spotlight as a promising alternative modality due to their enhanced stability compared to linear RNA. Nevertheless, sequencing circRNAs has presented challenges. In this context, we introduce a novel circRNA sequencing method called Induro-RT mediated circRNA-sequencing (IMCR-seq), which relies on a group II intron reverse transcriptase with robust rolling circle reverse transcription activity. The IMCR-seq protocol eliminates the need for conventional circRNA enrichment methods such as rRNA depletion and RNaseR digestion yet achieved the highest circRNA enrichment and detected 6-1000 times more circRNAs for the benchmarked human samples compared to other methods. IMCR-seq is applicable to any organism, capable of detecting circRNAs of more than 7,000 nucleotides, and is effective using as little as 10 ng of total RNA. These enhancements render IMCR-seq suitable for clinical samples, including disease tissues and liquid biopsies. To demonstrate IMCR-seq's clinical relevance, we applied it to lung tumor tissue and plasma samples from a healthy individual and a lung cancer patient and detected cancer-specific circRNAs as potential biomarkers.

44,200269394,Long-lived central memory gamma delta T cells confer protection against murine cytomegalovirus reinfection,"The involvement of γδ TCR-bearing lymphocytes in immunological memory has gained increasing interest due to their functional duality between adaptive and innate immunity. γδ T effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) subsets have been identified, but their respective roles in memory responses are poorly understood. In the present study, we used subsequent mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections of αβ T cell deficient mice in order to analyze the memory potential of γδ T cells. As for CMV-specific αβ T cells, MCMV induced the accumulation of cytolytic, KLRG1+CX3CR1+ γδ TEM that principally localized in infected organ vasculature. Typifying T cell memory, γδ T cell expansion in organs and blood was higher and more efficient after secondary viral challenge than after primary infection. Viral control upon MCMV reinfection was prevented when masking γδ T-cell receptor, and was associated with a preferential amplification of private and unfocused TCR δ chain repertoire composed of a combination of clonotypes expanded post-primary infection and, more unexpectedly, of novel expanded clonotypes. Finally, long-term-primed γδ TCM cells, but not γδ TEM cells, protected T cell-deficient hosts against MCMV-induced death upon adoptive transfer, probably through their ability to survive and to generate TEM in the recipient host. This better survival potential of TCM cells was confirmed by a detailed scRNASeq analysis of these two γδ T cell subsets which also revealed their similarity to classically adaptive αβ CD8 T cells. Overall, our study uncovered memory properties of long-lived TCM γδ T cells that confer protection in a chronic infection, highlighting the interest of this T cell subset in vaccination approaches.",Mus musculus,GSE269394,2024/07/25,1.3,1.0,1.0,2.0,"This dataset studies γδ T cells in the context of cytomegalovirus infection, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

45,200237425,Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct molecular alterations of human renal cell carcinoma-derived endothelial cells that are stable in ex vivo primary culture [scRNA-seq],"Even though tumor endothelial cells are a key component of the tumor microenvironment and represent the main interface between tumor cells and the host’s circulation and immune system, their phenotypes and functional properties are relatively poorly understood. To address this deficit, we purified tumor and matched normal endothelial cells from highly vascularized kidney cancer specimens and performed single cell RNA-seq to characterize endothelial cell gene expression patterns and heterogeneity. We found that tumor endothelial cells from multiple donors shared a common phenotype with increased expression of pathways related to extracellular matrix regulation, cell-cell communication and insulin growth factor signaling. We also found that while normal endothelial cells from kidney and liver were divergent, most tumor endothelial cells from kidney and liver cancer shared common gene expression signatures suggesting a congruence of tumor endothelial cell phenotypes. Using RNA-seq, we determined that many of the differentially regulated genes between tumor and normal endothelial cells were maintained in primary culture, which in turn permitted study of their functional phenotypes in vitro.

Plant defense elicitor peptides would be promising to manage diseases such as almond leaf scorch but their effect on the host has not been fully studied. In this work, the response of almond plants to the defense elicitor peptide flg22-NH2 was studied in-depth using RNA-seq, confirming the activation of the salicylic acid and abscisic acid pathways. Marker genes related to the response triggered by flg22-NH2 were used to study the effect of the application strategy of the peptide on almond plants and to depict its time course. The application of flg22-NH2 by endotherapy triggered the highest number of upregulated genes, especially at 6 hours after the treatment. A library of peptides that include BP100-flg15, HpaG23, FV7, RIJK2, PIP-1, Pep13, BP16-Pep13, flg15-BP100 and BP16 triggered a stronger defense response in almond plants than flg22-NH2. The best candidate, FV7, when applied by endotherapy on almond plants inoculated with X. fastidiosa, significantly reduced levels of the pathogen and decreased disease symptoms.

Dysregulation of mammary stem cells is a key mechanism for cancer development. However, stem cell characterization is challenging because reporter models using cell-specific promoters do not fully recapitulate the mammary stem cell populations. We previously found that a 270-basepair Runx1 enhancer element, named eR1, marked stem cells in the blood and stomach. Here, we identified eR1 activity in a rare subpopulation of the ERα-negative luminal epithelium in mouse mammary glands. Lineage-tracing using an eR1-CreERT2 mouse model revealed that eR1+ luminal cells generated the entire luminal lineage and milk-secreting alveoli – eR1 therefore specifically marks lineage-restricted luminal stem cells. eR1-targeted-conditional knockout of Runx1 led to the expansion of luminal epithelial cells, accompanied by elevated ERα expression. Our findings demonstrate a definitive role for Runx1 in the regulation of the eR1-positive luminal stem cell proliferation during mammary homeostasis.

49,200235325,In vivo single-cell CRISPR uncovers distinct TNF-α programs in tumor evolution,"The tumor evolution model posits that malignant transformation is preceded by randomly distributed driver mutations in cancer genes, which cause clonal expansions in phenotypically normal tissues. Although clonal expansions can remodel entire tissues1-3, the mechanisms behind why only a small number of clones transform into malignant tumors remain enigmatic. Here, we develop an in vivo single-cell CRISPR strategy to systematically investigate tissue-wide clonal dynamics of the 150 most frequently mutated squamous cell carcinoma genes. We couple ultrasound-guided in utero lentiviral microinjections, single-cell RNA sequencing and guide capture to longitudinally monitor clonal expansions and document their underlying gene programs at single-cell transcriptomic resolution. We uncover a TNF-α signaling module, dependent on TNF receptor 1 and involving macrophages, that acts as a generalizable driver of clonal expansions in epithelial tissues. Conversely, during tumorigenesis, the TNF-α signaling module is downregulated. Instead, we identify a subpopulation of invasive cancer cells that switch to an autocrine TNF-α gene program, associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition. Finally, we provide in vivo evidence that the autocrine TNF-α gene program is sufficient to mediate invasive properties and show that the TNF-α signature correlates with shorter overall survival in human squamous cell carcinoma patients.

51,200245245,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3991_RNA],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245245,2024/07/01,5.7,6.0,6.0,5.0,"This dataset identifies ferroptosis regulators in cancer cells, with implications for therapeutic strategies in lung cancer.

In vitro, microglia preferentially upregulate iron importer, divalent metal transporter 1 (DMT1, gene name Slc11a2) in response to inflammatory stimuli, and excess iron can augment cellular inflammation, suggesting a feed-forward loop between iron import mechanisms and inflammatory signaling. However, it is not understood whether microglial iron import mechanisms directly contribute to inflammatory signaling and chronic disease in vivo. These studies determined the effects of knocking down microglial iron import gene, Slc11a2, on AD-related cognitive decline and microglial transcriptional phenotype. Methods In vitro experiments and RT-qPCR were used to assess a role for DMT1 in amyloid-β-associated inflammation. To determine the effects of microglial Slc11a2 knockdown on AD-related phenotypes in vivo, triple-transgenic Cx3cr1Cre-ERT2;Slc11a2flfl;APP/PS1+ or – mice were generated and administered corn oil or tamoxifen to induce knockdown at 5-6 months of age. Both sexes underwent behavioral analyses to assess cognition and memory (12-15 months of age). Hippocampal CD11b+ microglia were magnetically isolated from female mice (15-17 months) and bulk RNA-sequencing analysis was conducted. Results DMT1 inhibition in vitro robustly decreased Aβ-induced inflammatory gene expression and cellular iron levels in conditions of excess iron. In vivo, Slc11a2KD APP/PS1 female, but not male, mice displayed a significant worsening of memory function in Morris water maze and a fear conditioning assay, along with significant hyperactivity compared to control WT and APP/PS1 mice. Hippocampal microglia from Slc11a2KD APP/PS1 females displayed significant increases in genes Enpp2, Ttr, and iron-export gene, Slc40a1, compared to control APP/PS1 cells. Slc11a2KD cells from APP/PS1 females also exhibited decreased expression of markers related to disease-associated microglia (DAMs), such as Apoe, Ctsb, Csf1, and Hif1α. Conclusions This work suggests a sex-specific role for microglial iron import gene Slc11a2 in propagating behavioral and cognitive phenotypes in the APP/PS1 model of AD. These data also highlight an association between loss of a DAM-like phenotype in female microglia and cognitive deficits in Slc11a2KD APP/PS1 mice. Overall, this work illuminates an iron-related pathway in microglia that may serve a protective role during disease and offers insight into mechanisms behind disease-related sex differences.",Mus musculus,GSE269314,2024/07/17,1.3,1.0,1.0,2.0,"This dataset studies microglial function in Alzheimer's disease, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

54,200193782,ScRNA-seq Expression of APOC2 and IFI27 Identifies Four Alveolar Macrophage Superclusters in Cystic Fibrosis and Healthy BALF,"Alveolar macrophages (AMs) reside on the luminal surface of the airways and alveoli, ensuring proper gas exchange by ingesting cellular debris and pathogens, and regulating inflammatory responses. Therefore, understanding the heterogeneity and diverse roles played by AMs, interstitial macrophages, and recruited monocytes is critical for treating airway diseases. We performed single-cell RNA sequencing on 113,213 bronchoalveolar lavage cells from four healthy and three uninflamed cystic fibrosis subjects and identified two MARCKS+LGMN+IMs, FOLR2+SELENOP+ and SPP1+PLA2G7+ IMs, monocyte subtypes, DC1, DC2, migDCs, plasmacytoid DCs, lymphocytes, epithelial cells, and four AM superclusters (families) based on the gene expression of IFI27 and APOC2 These four AM families have at least eight distinct functional members (subclusters) named after their differentially expressed gene(s): IGF1, CCL18, CXCL5, cholesterol, chemokine, metallothionein, interferon, and small-cluster AMs. Interestingly, the chemokine cluster further divides with each subcluster selectively expressing a unique combination of chemokines. One of the most striking observations, besides the heterogeneity, is the conservation of AM family members in relatively equal ratio across all AM superclusters and individuals. Transcriptional data and TotalSeq technology were used to investigate cell surface markers that distinguish resident AMs from recruited monocytes. Last, other AM datasets were projected onto our dataset. Similar AM superclusters and functional subclusters were observed, along with a significant increase in chemokine and IFN AM subclusters in individuals infected with COVID-19.

Here we apply a combination of single cell RNA sequencing and T/B cell repertoire analysis to perform an in-depth characterization of molecular changes in the immune-signature upon CD19 CAR T cell-mediated depletion of B cells in SLE patients. The resulting datasets do not only confirm a selective CAR T cell-mediated reset of the B cell response, but simultaneously reveal consequent changes in the transcriptional signature of monocyte and T cell subsets that respond with a profound reduction in type 1 interferon signaling.

59,200241625,Loss of Elp3 impairs the immune response to helminths by blocking intestinal tuft cell differentiation,"Intestinal tuft cells are critical in anti-helminth immunity by producing IL-25, which triggers IL-13 secretion by activated group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in order to ultimately expand both goblet and tuft cells. Translational reprogramming is involved in intestinal tuft cell differentiation but the role of tRNA modifications in this process is unknown. We show here that epithelial Elp3, a tRNA-modifying enzyme, promotes tuft cell differentiation and is consequently critical for IL-25 production, ILC2 activation, goblet cell expansion and control of N. brasiliensis infection in mice. Elp3 is essential for the IL-13-dependent induction of some glycolytic enzymes such as Hexokinase 1 and Aldolase A and consequently links specific metabolic pathways to tuft cell differentiation. Importantly, loss of epithelial Elp3 in the intestine blocks the translation of Nprl2, a mTORC1 inhibitor, which consequently enhances mTORC1 activation and stabilizes Atf4 in both transit amplifying and progenitor cells. Likewise, Atf4 overexpression in mouse intestinal epithelium blocks tuft cell differentiation and impairs the control of intestinal helminth infection. Collectively, our data define Atf4 as a negative regulator of tuft cell differentiation and provide insights into mechanisms through which some tRNA modifications promote a type 2 immune response to parasites in the intestine.",Mus musculus,GSE241625,2024/07/25,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset studies intestinal tuft cells and their role in helminth immunity, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

PTPRH, a receptor-like protein tyrosine, is deregulated or mutated in certain cancers, including non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nonetheless, the biological processes that PTPRH is involved in and how it may contribute to tumorigenesis are unknown. We aimed to understand how ovexpression of PTPRH affects tyrosine kinase signaling and in which biological processess this tyrosine phosphatase is involved in. We observed that overexpression of the phosphatase downregulates multiple oncogenic signature pathways and modulates the gene expression of 34 protein tyrosine phosphatases and 45 tyrosine kinases, EGFR included.

63,200247640,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment [CD4cre scRNA-seq],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE247640,2024/02/02,7.3,7.0,8.0,7.0,"This dataset examines T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment, which is highly relevant to immunotherapy for lung cancer.

65,200172059,Hedgehog-Responsive PDGFRa(+) Fibroblasts are Necessary for Maintenance of a Unique Pool of Alveolar Epithelial Progenitor Cells During Alveologenesis,"The adult lung alveolus is a flexible 3D structure composed of multiple epithelial, endothelial, and mesenchymal cell types. Two highly specialized alveolar type I (AT1) and type II (AT2) cells, derived from epithelial progenitors, form the inner lining of the alveolus. During alveologenesis, the increasing demand for epithelial cells to cover the surface of the expansive number of alveoli is met by proliferating progenitor cells. There is presently little information about the identity of this population, and the niche microenvironment that controls its proliferation. We show that during alveologenesis genetic inactivation of TGFreceptors in hedgehog-responsive, PDGFRa(+) mesodermal cells previously identified as secondary crest myofibroblasts or SCMF reduces their number, and depletes a unique pool of proliferative epithelial progenitors, without significantly impacting differentiation of cells existing the pool. SCMF are a source of both extracellular matrix and secreted trophic molecules and may thus constitute a key component of the epithelial progenitor niche during alveologenesis. Paralleling the mouse model, we found evidence of reduced proliferation of SFTPC(+) progenitors in lungs of human preterm infants who died with bronchopulmonary dysplasia or BPD. SCMF are a transient cell population, which are depleted at completion of alveologenesis, making them a unique stage-dependent niche mesodermal cell type in mammalian organs.",Mus musculus,GSE172059,2021/04/15,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset discusses alveolar epithelial progenitor cells and their role in lung development, but it does not specifically address lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Abnormal circadian rhythm (ACR) is related to the development of DCM in animal models, but exploration based on clinical samples is lacking. Sleep apnea (SA) is the most common disease related to ACR, and we chose SA as the study object to explore ACR-DCM. We included a DCM cohort and divided it into SA (n=76) and without SA group (n=29). RT-qPCR was used to determine the change of rhythm gene expression pattern. We used single-nucleus RNA sequencing (snRNA-seq) to explore the abnormal transcriptional patterns in the ACR group, and we verified the findings by pathological staining, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and Rev-erbα/β knockout (KO) mice analysis. DCM patients with SA showed decreased amplitude of rhythm gene expression. SA group showed more severe dilation of left heart chambers. From snRNA-seq, ACR-DCM lost the morning transcriptional patterns, detailly, actin cytoskeleton organization of cardiomyocytes (CMs) disrupted and hypertrophy aggravated, and the proportion of activated fibroblasts (Fibs) decreased with the reduction of fibrotic area ratio. The results of pathological staining, mechanical experiments, and transcriptional feature of Rev-erbα/β KO mice supported the above findings.

67,200264573,Single Cell Analysis of Treatment–Resistant Prostate Cancer: Implications of Cell State Changes for Cell Surface Antigen Targeted Therapies,"Targeting cell surface molecules using radioligand and antibody–based therapies has yielded considerable success across cancers. However, it remains unclear how the expression of putative lineage markers, particularly cell surface molecules, varies in the process of lineage plasticity, wherein tumor cells alter their identity and acquire new oncogenic properties. A notable example of lineage plasticity is the transformation of prostate adenocarcinoma (PRAD) to neuroendocrine prostate cancer (NEPC)––a growing resistance mechanism that results in the loss of responsiveness to androgen blockade and portends dismal patient survival. To understand how lineage markers vary across the evolution of lineage plasticity in prostate cancer, we applied single cell analyses to 21 human prostate tumor biopsies and two genetically engineered mouse models, together with tissue microarray analysis (TMA) on 131 tumor samples. Not only did we observe a higher degree of phenotypic heterogeneity in castrate–resistant PRAD and NEPC than previously anticipated, but also found that the expression of molecules targeted therapeutically, namely PSMA, STEAP1, STEAP2, TROP2, CEACAM5, and DLL3, varied within a subset of gene–regulatory networks (GRNs). We also noted that NEPC and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) subtypes shared a set of GRNs, indicative of conserved biologic pathways that may be exploited therapeutically across tumor types. While this extreme level of transcriptional heterogeneity, particularly in cell surface marker expression, may mitigate the durability of clinical responses to novel antigen–directed therapies, its delineation may yield signatures for patient selection in clinical trials, potentially across distinct cancer types.",Homo sapiens,GSE264573,2024/05/20,1.3,1.0,1.0,2.0,"This dataset investigates prostate cancer and its treatment resistance, which is not relevant to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

69,200266143,Macrophage-mediated myelin-recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy (RNA-Seq in vitro),"Tumors growing in metabolically-challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on cross-talk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. However, the intricacies of this metabolic interplay and the consequences on immune cell subset diversity and function remain largely unexplored. We interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single cell multi-omics analyses in preclinical glioblastoma mouse models and patient samples, and identified metabolically-rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations that fuel glioblastoma malignancy. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their increased lipid metabolism activity and cholesterol storage, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. In response to TME-derived cues triggering liver-X-receptor (LXR) expression, macrophages increase engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris and acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Furthermore, LLM content predicts clinical outcomes and immune checkpoint blockade response in glioblastoma patients and other cancer types.

Myalgia and fatigue represent two of the most prevalent symptoms in post-COVID-19 syndrome. To determine the mechanisms underlying prolonged muscle symptoms, we characterized longitudinal histopathological and transcriptional changes of skeletal muscle after acute respiratory SARS-CoV-2 infection in a COVID-19 hamster model and compared them with respiratory influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Histopathological and bulk RNA sequencing analyses at 3, 30, and 60 days post infection (dpi) showed no evidence of direct viral invasion, inflammatory cell infiltration, or microthrombi in skeletal muscle, but myofiber atrophy was observed in the SARS-CoV-2 group at 60 dpi, accompanied by downregulation of myofiber genes, atrogenes, and cytoplasmic ribosomal protein genes, and upregulation of autophagy genes. There was persistent downregulation of genes involved in mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, fatty acid beta-oxidation, and tricarboxylic acid cycle in the SARS-CoV-2 but not the IAV group. Moreover, TNF-alpha/NF-kB and TGF-beta signaling pathways were differentially regulated in the SARS-CoV-2 group.

73,200249362,Non-Canonical BAF and mSWI/SNF Regulates POU2F3 and are Selective Targetable Dependencies for POU2F3-Positive Small Cell Lung Cancer,"~12% of SCLCs are marked by the lineage transcription factor POU2F3, which is essential in all POU2F3-positive SCLCs. Thus, approaches to directly or indirectly inhibit POU2F3 could lead to new therapeutic strategies for POU2F3-positive SCLCs. Here we use a positive selection screening strategy where endogenous POU2F3 is fused to the suicide gene DCK*. Cells that express endogenous POU2F3-DCK* are killed in the presence of the nucleoside analog BVdU and only cells that downregulate the POU2F3-DCK* fusion survive. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 resistance screens with BVdU in POU2F3-DCK* cells uncovered that inactivation of SMARCD1 or BRD9, both components of the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex, markedly downregulate endogenous POU2F3. We find that all POU2F3-positive SCLC cell lines relative to ASCL1-positive and NEUROD1-positive cell lines, are exquisitely sensitive to mSWI/SNF complex inhibition using SMARCA2/4 inhibitors; while pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-positive SCLC cell lines are highly sensitive to ncBAF complex inhibition using highly selective BRD9 degraders. Mechanistically, BRD9 binds and regulates POU2F3 target genes including POU2F3 itself. BRD9 degraders or SMARCA2/4 inhibitors robustly decrease accessibility of POU2F3 target genes effectively shutting off POU2F3 function. Moreover, BRD9 degraders or SMARCA2/4 inhibitors decrease tumor growth and increase survival of mice bearing non-neuroendocrine POU2F3 xenografts.

74,200230874,The DNA-repair protein APE1 contributes with hnRNPA2B1 to motif-enriched miRNA secretion,"The base excision repair (BER) Apurinic/apyrimidinic endonuclease 1 (APE1) enzyme is endowed with several non-repair activities, such as the cell response to genotoxic stress, the regulation of gene expression and miRNAs processing. We recently demonstrated that APE1 can be actively secreted by mammalian cells through exosomes. The role of APE1 in exosomes is still unknown, especially regarding the molecular mechanism involving small non-coding RNAs vesicular secretion. miRNAs loading into exosomes is a regulated and selective process, since not all the expressed miRNAs are indistinctly conveyed into exosomes. Through a dedicated transcriptomic analysis on cellular and vesicular small RNAs, we identified secreted miRNAs characterized by enriched sequence motifs and possible binding sites for APE1. In 50 out of 53 DE-miRNA precursors, we surprisingly found EXO motifs and proved that APE1 cooperates with hnRNPA2B1 for the EV-sorting of a subsets of miRNAs, including miR-1246, through a direct binding to GGAG stretch. We provide evidence of a new post-transcriptional role for this ubiquitous DNA-repair enzyme towards miRNAs secretion mechanisms, that could be exploited to interfere with tumor microenvironment.",Homo sapiens,GSE230874,2024/07/24,1.3,1.0,2.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates miRNA secretion mechanisms, which are unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization.

It is therefore of tremendous interest to bypass immunosuppressive signaling in the tumor microenvironment and to identify factors that augment T cell immunometabolism, cytotoxic effector functions and eventually tumor killing. Whether ionic signals serve as aberrant immune signals and influence the adaptive human antitumor immune response is still largely unexplored. We demonstrate a significant enrichment of sodium in solid tumors of breast cancer patients, which leaves a transcriptomic imprint on intratumoral immune cells. Sodium chloride (NaCl) enhanced the activation state and effector functions of human CD8+ memory T cells. These functional alterations were associated with improved metabolic fitness, in particular with an increase in glycolysis and oxidative phosphorylation and overall nutrient uptake. These NaCl-induced effects translated into increased tumor cell killing in vitro and in a tumor mouse model in vivo. We therefore propose NaCl as a positive regulator of acute antitumor immunity, which could be harnessed for ex vivo conditioning of adoptively transferred T cells in the future.",Homo sapiens,GSE232149,2024/06/21,8.7,9.0,8.0,9.0,"This dataset investigates how sodium chloride in the tumor microenvironment enhances T cell function and cytotoxicity, which is directly relevant to immunotherapy for lung cancer.

80,200262149,A whole-genome CRISPR screen identifies the spindle accessory checkpoint as a locus of nab-paclitaxel resistance in pancreatic cancer cells.,"Pancreatic adenocarcinoma is one of the most aggressive and lethal forms of cancer. Chemotherapy is the primary treatment for pancreatic cancer, but resistance to the drugs used remains a major challenge. A genome-wide CRISPR interference and knockout screen in the PANC-1 cell line with the drug nab-paclitaxel has identified a group of spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC) genes that enhance survival in nab-paclitaxel. Knockdown of these SAC genes (BUB1B, BUB3, and TTK) attenuates paclitaxel-induced cell death. Cells treated with the small molecule inhibitors BAY 1217389 or MPI 0479605, targeting the threonine tyrosine kinase (TTK), also enhance survival in paclitaxel. Overexpression of these SAC genes does not affect sensitivity to paclitaxel. These discoveries have helped to elucidate the mechanisms behind paclitaxel cytotoxicity.

81,200238159,Conserved long noncoding RNA TILAM promotes liver fibrosis in humans and mice.,"Fibrosis is the common endpoint for all forms of chronic liver injury, and progression of fibrosis is responsible for the development of end stage liver disease and liver failure. The activation of hepatic stellate cells (HSCs) and their transition to HSC myofibroblasts is a key step in the disease process, as these cells are the primary source of the extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins, which form the fibrotic scar. Long noncoding (lnc) RNAs can regulate the activity of HSCs, and lncRNAs that promote the fibrotic activity of HSCs may provide targets for antifibrotic therapies. Here, we identified and defined the functional mechanisms of a conserved lncRNA that plays a critical role in promoting liver fibrosis. We found that TILAM is conserved between human and mouse HSCs, and regulates expression of type 1 collagen, a major component of the ECM. To determine the role of TILAM in vivo, we annotated the mouse ortholog (Tilam), generated Tilam-deficient GFP-reporter mice, and challenged these mice in two different models of liver fibrosis. Analysis of GFP expression revealed that Tilam is induced in murine HSCs with the development of fibrosis in vivo. In both male and female mice, we also observed that loss of Tilam resulted in reduced fibrosis in the setting of injury induced by carbon tetrachloride (CCl4) and choline-deficient L-amino acid defined high fat diet (CDA-HFD). Finally, we found that TILAM interacts with PML to stabilize PML protein expression and promote the fibrotic activity of HSCs. Together, these results define an lncRNA conserved between humans and mice that is activated uniquely in HSCs to drive the development of fibrosis and could provide a therapeutic target to combat the development of end stage liver disease.",Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,GSE238159,2024/07/22,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"This dataset investigates liver fibrosis and the role of long noncoding RNAs in liver disease, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapies.

87,200266144,Macrophage-mediated myelin-recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy (RNA-Seq in vivo),"Tumors growing in metabolically-challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on cross-talk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. However, the intricacies of this metabolic interplay and the consequences on immune cell subset diversity and function remain largely unexplored. We interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single cell multi-omics analyses in preclinical glioblastoma mouse models and patient samples, and identified metabolically-rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations that fuel glioblastoma malignancy. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their increased lipid metabolism activity and cholesterol storage, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. In response to TME-derived cues triggering liver-X-receptor (LXR) expression, macrophages increase engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris and acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Furthermore, LLM content predicts clinical outcomes and immune checkpoint blockade response in glioblastoma patients and other cancer types.

90,200268048,The effect of exposure to neighborhood violence on GR signaling in lung tumors [CUT&Run],"Despite lower rates and intensity of smoking, Black men experience a higher incidence of lung cancer compared to White men. The racial disparity in lung cancer is particularly pronounced in Chicago, a highly segregated urban city. Neighborhood conditions, particularly social stress, may play a role in lung tumorigenesis. Preliminary studies indicate that Black men residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime have significantly higher levels of hair cortisol, an indicator of stress response. To examine the relationship between social stress exposure and gene expression in lung tumors, we investigated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in lung tumor samples in relation to GR target gene expression levels and zip code level residential neighborhood violence. Spatial transcriptomics and a version of ChIP-sequencing known as CUT & RUN were used. GR recruitment to chromatin was correlated with neighborhood violent crime rate and overall GR binding increased with increasing neighborhood violent crime rates. Among patients residing in high-violence neighborhoods, tumor samples, compared to normal neighboring lung tissue, had fewer GR binding sites. The opposite was seen in patients residing in low-violence neighborhoods, with tumor samples having more GR binding sites when compared to normal lung tissue. Tumor samples from patients living in high-violence neighborhoods exhibited increased GR recruitment to genes associated with greater tumor aggressiveness.

In the myeloid compartment, increased presence of dendritic cell populations (pDC, aDC, and iDC) and basophils was observed in responders to TIL therapy, as well as higher content of γδ T cells and effector memory CD8+ T cells (CD8+ Tem) in the T-cell compartment. Next, we assessed the TLS presence in the same cohort by a gene expression signature of 12 chemokines using principal component analysis. The responders showed a higher TLS score compared with the non-responder patients, suggesting that patients responding to TIL therapy had more TLS in their tumors than the non-responder patients.

94,200246354,GCN2 is a determinant of the response to WEE1 kinase inhibition in small-cell lung cancer,"Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) are in dire need of more effective therapeutic options. Frequent disruption of the G1 checkpoint in SCLC cells creates a greater dependency of these cells on the G2/M checkpoint to maintain genomic integrity. Indeed, in pre-clinical models, inhibiting the G2/M kinase WEE1 shows promise in inhibiting SCLC growth. However, toxicity and acquired resistance limit the clinical effectiveness of this strategy. Here we conducted CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes influencing the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 kinase inhibition. These screens uncovered a role for the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway in modulating the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 inhibition. Rapid activation of GCN2 upon WEE1 inhibition triggers a stress response. Pharmacological activation of the GCN2 pathway synergizes with WEE1 inhibition. Thus, activation of the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway represents a novel approach for augmenting the efficacy of WEE1 inhibitors in SCLC.",Homo sapiens,GSE246354,2024/07/16,8.7,8.0,9.0,9.0,"This dataset investigates the response to WEE1 kinase inhibition in small-cell lung cancer, which is relevant to lung cancer treatment strategies.

95,200259271,Therapeutic targeting ERRγ suppresses metastasis via extracellular matrix remodeling in small cell lung cancer (RNA-Seq),"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive and lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by limited treatment options, early and frequent metastasis. However, the determinants of metastasis in SCLC are poorly defined. Here, we show that estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) is overexpressed in metastatic SCLC tumors, and it is positively associated with SCLC progression. ERRγ functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERRγ markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERRγ antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models. Taken together, these findings establish ERRγ as an attractive target for metastatic SCLC and provide a potential pharmacological strategy for treating this lethal disease.",Homo sapiens,GSE259271,2024/05/15,9.7,9.0,10.0,10.0,This dataset discusses targeting ERRγ in small-cell lung cancer and its implications for metastasis and treatment strategies.

96,200247217,Targeting DHX9 triggers interferon response and replication stress in Small Cell Lung Cancer [RIP-Seq II],"Activating innate immunity in cancer cells through cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing pathways, a phenomenon known as “viral mimicry”, has emerged as an effective strategy to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot”. Through a curated CRISPR-based screen of RNA Helicases, we identified DExD/H-box helicase 9 (DHX9) as a potent repressor of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). Depletion of DHX9 induced accumulation of cytoplasmic dsRNA and triggered tumor-intrinsic innate immunity. Intriguingly, ablating DHX9 also induced aberrant accumulation of R-loops, which resulted in an increase of DNA damage-derived cytoplasmic DNA and replication stress in SCLCs. In vivo, DHX9 deletion promoted decrease in tumor growth while inducing a more immunogenic tumor microenvironment, invigorating responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. These findings suggest that DHX9 is a crucial repressor of tumor-intrinsic innate immunity and replication stress, representing a promising target for SCLC and other “cold” tumors where genomic instability contribute to pathology.",Homo sapiens,GSE247217,2024/02/01,8.3,8.0,9.0,8.0,"This dataset examines the role of DHX9 in small-cell lung cancer and its effects on tumor immunity and replication stress.

98,200226471,ICOS-expressing Treg cells influence the composition of anti-tumor CTL population,"The role of ICOS in anti-tumor T cell responses and overall tumor progression has been controversial. Here, we compared tumor progression in mice lacking ICOS only in Treg cells or in all T cells. We found that Treg-specific ICOS knockout reduces the overall tumor burden compared to Cre control mice with increased T effector/Treg ratios in the tumor. In contrast, there was no difference in the tumor burden in mice lacking ICOS in all the T cell compartments. This suggests a dual role of ICOS costimulation in promoting pro- and anti-tumor T cell responses. Consistent with reduced tumor burden, we found that Treg-specific deletion of ICOS leads to an increase of CD8+ CTLs that express high levels of granzyme B and perforin. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed an increase of Ly108hiEomeshi CD8+ T cell subset at the cost of Ly108hiT-bethi subset in Treg-specific knockout mice. These results suggest that ICOS-expressing Treg cells suppress CTL maturation process at the level of Eomes upregulation, a critical step known to drive perforin expression and cytotoxicity.

101,200266147,Macrophage-mediated myelin-recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy (VISIUM),"Tumors growing in metabolically-challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on cross-talk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. However, the intricacies of this metabolic interplay and the consequences on immune cell subset diversity and function remain largely unexplored. We interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single cell multi-omics analyses in preclinical glioblastoma mouse models and patient samples, and identified metabolically-rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations that fuel glioblastoma malignancy. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their increased lipid metabolism activity and cholesterol storage, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. In response to TME-derived cues triggering liver-X-receptor (LXR) expression, macrophages increase engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris and acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Furthermore, LLM content predicts clinical outcomes and immune checkpoint blockade response in glioblastoma patients and other cancer types.

102,200221070,Adapter CAR-T cells to counteract T cell exhaustion and enable flexible targeting in AML ,"Although the landscape for treating acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients has changed substantially in recent years, the majority of patients will eventually relapse and succumb to their disease. Allogeneic stem cell transplantation provides the best anti-leukemia treatment strategy, but is only suitable in a minority of patients. In contrast to B-cell neoplasias, chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy in AML has encountered challenges in target antigen heterogeneity, safety, and T-cell dysfunction. We developed a Fab-based adapter CAR (AdCAR) T-cell platform with flexibility of targeting and control of AdCAR T-cell activation. Utilizing AML cell lines and a long-term culture assay for primary AML cells, we were able to demonstrate AML-specific cytotoxicity using anti-CD33, anti-CD123, and anti-CLL1 adapter molecules in vitro and in vivo. Notably, we show for the first time the feasibility of sequential application of adapter molecules of different specificity in primary AML co-cultures. Importantly, utilizing the AML platform, we were able to demonstrate that continuous adapter molecule exposure led to AdCAR T-cell exhaustion through chronic AdCAR stimulation, which was counteracted through treatment-free intervals. As CAR T-cell exhaustion is a well-known cause of resistance, the AdCAR platform might ameliorate CAR T-cell dysfunction.",Homo sapiens,GSE221070,2023/09/08,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset is centered on CAR-T cell therapy for acute myeloid leukemia (AML), which is unrelated to lung cancer.

105,200272134,In vivo CRISPR base editing for treatment of Huntington’s disease,"Huntington's disease (HD) is an inherited and ultimately fatal neurodegenerative disorder caused by an expanded polyglutamine-encoding CAG repeat within exon 1 of the huntingtin (HTT) gene, which produces a mutant protein that destroys striatal and cortical neurons.Importantly, a critical event in the pathogenesis of HD is the proteolytic cleavage of the mutant HTT protein by caspase-6, which generates fragments of the N-terminal domain of the protein that form highly toxic aggregates. Given the role that proteolysis of the mutant HTT protein plays in HD, strategies forpreventing this process hold potential for treating the disorder.By screening 141 CRISPR base editor variants targeting splice elements in the HTT gene, we identified platforms capable of producing HTT protein isoforms resistant to caspase-6-mediated proteolysis via editing of the splice acceptor sequence for exon 13. When delivered to the striatum of a rodent HD model, these base editors induced efficient exon skipping and decreased the formation of the N-terminal fragments, which in turn reduced HTT protein aggregation and attenuatedstriatal and cortical atrophy.Collectively, these results illustrate the potential for CRISPR base editing to decrease the toxicity of the mutant HTT protein for HD.",Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,GSE272134,2024/07/12,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on Huntington's disease and CRISPR base editing, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

106,200243955,EZH2 Inhibition Enhances PD-L1 Protein Stability through USP22-Mediated Deubiquitination in Colorectal Cancer,"Background: Previous studies have shown that EZH2 regulates tumor PD-L1 expression at the transcriptional level and has an impact on tumor immune environment and prognosis. However, whether EZH2 can regulate PD-L1 expression at the post-translational level remains unclear. Therefore, this study aims to investigate the effects of EZH2 inhibition on PD-L1 expression and protein stability in colorectal cancer cells, uncover its underlying mechanisms, and provide new therapeutic strategies for anti-tumor immune therapy. Methods: Multiple colorectal cancer cell models were used to examine the effects of EZH2 inhibition on PD-L1 expression and protein stability at both the protein and transcriptional levels. Transcriptome analysis was performed to identify differentially expressed genes associated with EZH2 inhibition and potential effectors involved in EZH2-mediated regulation of PD-L1 protein stability. Validation of candidate genes was conducted through public database analysis and knockdown or overexpression models. Finally, the combined effects of EZH2 inhibitors and anti-PD-1 immune therapy were evaluated using a mouse xenograft model. Results: We observed that inhibition of EZH2 function upregulated PD-L1 expression and enhanced its protein stability in colorectal cancer cells. Transcriptome analysis revealed that ubiquitin-specific protease 22 (USP22) played a crucial role in mediating EZH2-regulated PD-L1 protein stability. EZH2 affected USP22 expression through its classical epigenetic regulatory function, thereby modulating PD-L1 expression stability and influencing the tumor immune microenvironment. Combination treatment with EZH2 inhibitors and anti-PD-1 immune therapy improved the tumor microenvironment, promoted immune cell infiltration, and exerted synergistic anti-cancer effects. Conclusion: This study elucidated the mechanisms by EZH2 regulate PD-L1 expression and stability, providing new insights into therapeutic strategies for colorectal cancer. The combination of EZH2 inhibitors and anti-PD-1 immune therapy can synergistically enhance anti-tumor effects.

Early and accurate detection of transformed (t)SCLC has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. To address this unmet need, we first comprehensively profiled the epigenomes of metastatic lung tumors finding widespread epigenomic reprogramming during histologic transformation from LUAD to SCLC. We then utilized a novel approach for epigenomic profiling of cell-free DNA, which discriminated patients with EGFR mutant tSCLC from patients with EGFR mutant LUAD with greater than 90% accuracy.

Here, we generated circular RNAs (circRNAs) encoding Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) transmembrane proteins, referred to as circRNACAR, which mediated remarkable tumor killing in both T cells and macrophages. In addition, macrophages exhibited efficient phagocytosis of tumor cells and pro-inflammatory polarization induced by circRNACAR in vitro. We demonstrated that circRNACAR, delivered with immunocyte-tropic lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), significantly inhibited tumor growth, improved survival rates and induced a pro-inflammatory tumor microenvironment in mice. Importantly, the combination of circRNAAnti-HER2-CAR and circRNA-based cancer vaccines encoding the corresponding transmembrane HER2 antigen, termed circRNAHER2, exhibited synergistically enhanced anti-tumor activity.

111,200260524,Spon1+ inflammatory monocytes promote collagen remodeling and lung cancer metastasis through lipoprotein receptor 8 signaling.,"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the world, and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is the most common subset. Although immune checkpoint inhibitors have improved outcomes in a subset of NSCLC patients, these effects are usually not durable. Thus, a more complete understanding of how immune niches within the tumor microenvironment (TME) promote NSCLC progression will allow us to build upon these advances. We previously found that infiltration of tumor inflammatory monocytes (TIMs) into lung squamous carcinoma (LUSC) tumors is associated with increased metastases and poor survival. To further understand how TIMs promote metastases, we compared RNA-seq profiles of TIMs from several LUSC metastatic models with IMs of non-tumor bearing controls. We identified Spon1, a secreted extracellular matrix glycoprotein, as upregulated in TIMs and that Spon1 expression in LUSC tumors corresponds with poor survival. Bioinformatic analyses of the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) revealed that LUSC tumors with high SPON1 expression significantly enriched for collagen extracellular matrix (ECM) signatures. Unexpectedly, we observed SPON1+ TIMs mediate their effects directly through LRP8 (ApoER2) on NSCLC cells, which results in TGFβ1 activation and robust production of fibrillar collagens. Using several orthogonal approaches, we demonstrate that SPON1+ TIMs are sufficient to promote NSCLC metastases.

113,200264373,A novel gain-of-function phosphorylation site modulates PTPN22 inhibition of TCR signaling,"Protein Tyrosine Phosphatase Non-receptor type 22 (PTPN22) is encoded by a major autoimmunity gene and is a known inhibitor of T cell receptor (TCR) signaling and drug target for cancer immunotherapy. However, little is known about PTPN22 post-translational regulation. Here we characterize a phosphorylation site at Ser325 situated C-terminal to the catalytic domain of PTPN22, and its roles in altering protein function. Signaling through the major TCR-dependent pathway under PTPN22 control was enhanced by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated suppression of Ser325 phosphorylation and inhibited by mimicking it via glutamic acid substitution. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) revealed it differentially regulates the expression of chemokines and T cell activation pathways.

A significantly increased early resorption rate and decreased placental weight was observed in irradiated mice. There were no statistically significant differences in litter size, fetal weight, length, or malformation rate between the groups. Near-continuous radiation had no significant effects on mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), endoplasmic reticulum stress or inflammatory signaling, rate of double-stranded DNA breaks, and had minimal effects on gene expression in the placenta.

116,200268498,The endothelin-1-driven tumor-stroma feed-forward loops in high-grade serous ovarian cancer,"The high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HG-SOC) tumor microenvironment (TME) is constellated by cellular elements and a network of soluble constituents that contribute to tumor progression. In the multitude of the secreted molecules, the endothelin-1 (ET-1) has emerged to be implicated in the tumor/TME interplay, however the molecular mechanisms induced by the ET-1-driven feed-forward loops (FFL) and associated with the HG-SOC metastatic potential need to be further investigated. The tracking of the patient-derived (PD) HG-SOC cell transcriptome by RNA-seq identified the vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) gene and its associated signature among those mostly upregulated by ET-1 and down-modulated by the dual ET-1R antagonist macitentan. Within the ligand-receptor pairs concurrently expressed in PD-HG-SOC cells, endothelial cells and activated fibroblasts, we discovered two intertwined FFL, the ET-1/ET-1R and VEGF/VEGF receptors, concurrently activated by ET-1 and shutting-down by macitentan, or by the anti-VEGF antibody bevacizumab. In parallel, we observed that ET-1 fine-tuned the tumoral and stromal secretome towards a pro-invasive pattern. Into the fray of the HG-SOC/TME double and triple co-cultures, the secretion of ET-1 and VEGF, that share a common co-regulation, was inhibited upon the administration of macitentan. Functionally, macitentan, mimicking the effect of bevacizumab, interfered with the HG-SOC/TME FFL-driven communication that fuel the HG-SOC invasive behaviour. The identification of ET-1 and VEGF FFL as tumor and TME actionable vulnerabilities, reveal how ET-1R blockade, targeting the HG-SOC cells and the TME simultaneously, may represent an effective therapeutic option for HG-SOC patients.",Homo sapiens,GSE268498,2024/07/17,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates high-grade serous ovarian cancer, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

117,200247641,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment [pd1tim3 scRNA-seq],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE247641,2024/02/02,6.0,5.0,6.0,7.0,"This dataset discusses T cell exhaustion and its implications for immunotherapy, which is relevant to lung cancer.

DNA binding proteins, particularly transcription factors (TF), are crucial in regulating gene expression and downstream protein functions. Studying the intricate DNA-protein interactions helps unravel specific functions of TFs that are involved in cancer pathogenesis, identify regulatory pathways, and ultimately uncover therapeutic targets. Currently, the lack of high-throughput screening techniques makes research in cancer associated-TFs challenging. Therefore, we have developed an innovative Iso-CUT&MAP (Isolated cell-based Cut Under Target and Mapping Apoptotic Protein-binding sequences). Here, K562 tumor cells were coencapsulated with NK92 and antibody-conjugated (NFkB/RelA) magnetic beads in a microfluidic droplet-based system. After NK92 immune cells killed the K562 target cells, we collected RelA-bound DNA from the dead cells and analyzed DNA-binding sites using ChIP-seq. The results reveal the RelA genome-wide association study (GWAS) of the target K562 tumor cells in response to immune cell killing. The genome-wide mapping matched the expected profile of NFkB, validating the ability of our Iso-CUT&MAP method to accurately identify NFkB binding in response to NK92 killing of K562.

123,200259272,Therapeutic targeting ERRγ suppresses metastasis via extracellular matrix remodeling in small cell lung cancer (ChIP-Seq),"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive and lethal type of lung cancer, characterized by limited treatment options, early and frequent metastasis. However, the determinants of metastasis in SCLC are poorly defined. Here, we show that estrogen-related receptor gamma (ERRγ) is overexpressed in metastatic SCLC tumors, and it is positively associated with SCLC progression. ERRγ functions as an essential activator of ECM remodeling and cell adhesion, two critical steps in metastasis, by directly regulating the expression of major genes involved in these processes. Genetic and pharmacological inhibition of ERRγ markedly reduces collagen production, cell-matrix adhesion, microfilaments production, and eventually blocks SCLC cell invasion and tumor metastasis. Notably, ERRγ antagonists significantly suppress tumor growth and metastasis and restore resistant SCLC vulnerability to chemotherapy in multiple cell-derived and patient-derived xenograft models.

124,200247336,Analysis of the epigenetic profiles for HER2 CD8+ CAR T cells cultured under short-term resting conditions and overexpressing FOXO1WT,"T cell exhaustion and metabolic dysfunction induced by chronic antigen stimulation within the tumor microenvironment represent formidable obstacles in CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors. Previously, we developed a method to convert effector/exhausted CAR T cells that emerge from repeated antigen stimulation into stem cell memory-like CAR T (termed CAR-iTSCM) cells. These CAR-iTSCM cells exhibit expression of early memory markers and enhanced mitochondrial metabolism after quiescence under culture conditions containing IL-7, CXCL12, and the NOTCH-ligand. However, we noticed that this strategy was effective for CD19-CAR used for blood cancers, but not for HER2 CAR commonly used to treat solid tumors, due to tonic CAR signals. In this study, we developed a new culture condition for CAR iTSCM cells suitable for HER2 CAR and elucidated the mechanism of induction of stemness and mitochondrial fitness. We found that short-term resting condition with IL-7, CXCL12, and pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib can induce stem-like CAR T cells at the epigenetic level and enhance mitochondrial metabolism. We identified FOXO1 as a critical regulator in the process of epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, and anti-tumor activity. We found that overexpression of FOXO1 leads to enhanced mitochondrial metabolism, efficient CAR T cell expansion, and potent anti-tumor effects through epigenetic modifications. These findings suggest that regulating the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 is a promising strategy for engineering effective CAR T cells for treating solid tumors.

125,200236140,NOTCH3 Blockade Inhibits Cancer Cell Plasticity through a NOTCH3/PD-L1 Oncogenic Axis in Triple Negative Breast Cancer,"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) accounts for 15-20% of all breast cancers and mainly affects pre-menopausal and minority women. Therapeutic options are yet limited, in part because of acquisition of tumor cells with cancer stem cell (CSC) properties, leading to intrinsic resistance to chemotherapeutic agents and immune evasion capacity. Dysregulated Notch signaling has been linked to breast cancer and in this study, we demonstrate the pivotal role of NOTCH3 in inducing the enrichment of chemoresistant ALDHhigh CSCs. Significantly, selective targeting of NOTCH3 with AV-353, a novel humanized monoclonal antibody, or by shRNA-mediated knockdown, impaired the enrichment of ALDHhigh CSCs with high self-renewal capacity, induced apoptosis and enhanced chemosensitivity. AV-353 treatment similarly reduced growth of xenografted tumors in vivo. Moreover, blocking NOTCH3 by AV-353 or shRNA reduced PD-L1 expression in TNBC cells, which was linked to the inhibition of tumor growth and enhancement of CD8+ T-cell infiltration.

126,200255468,Functionalized nanowires for miRNA-mediated therapeutic programming of naïve T cells,"Cellular programming of naïve T cells, in contrast to activated T cells, can enhance the efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy. The differentiation of naïve cells into memory T cells impairs adoptive immunotherapy. Most current strategies for ex vivo engineering of T cells require pre-activation of T cells, with CD3/CD28 crosslinking antibodies or cytokines, prior to the delivery of genetic material, and therefore T cells lose the naïve state. Here, using a cationic polymer-functionalized nanowire platform, we pre-programmed the fate of primary, naïve CD8+ T cells to achieve the therapeutic response in vivo. We demonstrate the delivery of single versus multiple microRNAs (miRNAs) to primary naïve mouse and human CD8+ T cells without pre-activation, allowing for T cell programming in user-specific ways, as well as delivery of large, whole lentiviral particles with potential for long-term integration. Because CD8 T cell differentiation is a continuous process where fate decisions require the interplay of multiple miRNAs, we demonstrate how a combination of deletion and overexpression of miR-29 and miR-130 impact ex vivo T cell differentiation fate from the naïve state. The programming of CD8+ T cells using nanowire-delivered co-delivery of miRNAs resulted in the modulation of T cell fitness by altering T cell proliferation, phenotypic and transcriptional regulation, and secretion of effector molecules. Importantly, the in vivo adoptive transfer of murine CD8+ T cells programmed through nanowire-mediated dual delivery of miRNAs provided enhanced immune protection against different types of intracellular pathogens (influenza, Listeria monocytogenes). Nanowires open up therapeutic possibilities for adoptive T cell transfers where the amounts of effector differentiation in CD8+ T cells can be fine-tuned to achieve the therapeutic response in vivo.",Mus musculus,GSE255468,2024/04/03,4.7,5.0,6.0,3.0,"This dataset discusses programming naïve T cells for enhanced adoptive T cell therapy, which is relevant to immunotherapy.

We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects. These findings support further development of CpG-STAT3 inhibitors as a new bi-functional agents for AML immunotherapy.",Mus musculus,GSE233096,2024/07/23,3.7,4.0,4.0,3.0,"This dataset investigates AML and its immunogenicity, which is somewhat relevant to immunotherapy.

129,200243587,Cell-based models of ‘Cytokine Release Syndrome’ endorse CD40L and GM-CSF knockout in CAR T cells as mitigation strategy,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells are engineered lymphocytes able to recognize and eradicate cancer cells. While CAR T cell therapy has shown promising outcomes in patients with hematologic malignancies, it can cause undesirable side-effects such as cytokine release syndrome (CRS). CRS is triggered by CAR T cell-based activation of monocytes, which are stimulated via the CD40L–CD40R axis or via uptake of GM-CSF to secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines. Mouse models have been used to model CRS but they are labor intensive and not amenable to screening approaches. To overcome this challenge, we established two cell-based CRS in vitro models that entail the co-culturing of leukemic B cells with CD19-targeting CAR T cells and primary monocytes from the same donor. Upon antigen encounter, CAR T cells upregulated CD40L and GM-CSF which stimulated the monocytes to release IL-6. To endorse these models, we demonstrated that neutralizing antibodies or genetic disruption of the CD40L and/or CSF2 loci in CAR T cells using CRISPR-Cas technology significantly reduced IL-6 secretion by bystander monocytes without affecting the cytolytic activity of the engineered lymphocytes. Overall, our cell-based models were able to recapitulate CRS in vitro, allowing us to validate mitigation strategies based on antibodies or genome editing.",Homo sapiens,GSE243587,2023/12/06,4.7,5.0,5.0,4.0,"This dataset examines CAR T cell therapy and its side effects, including cytokine release syndrome.

130,200272895,Profiling the rat cortical single-cell transcriptome reveals the potential mechanism of specific mode electroacupuncture stimulation opening the blood-brain barrier,"The existence of the blood-brain barrier (BBB) dramatically limits the drug treatment of central nervous system diseases such as stroke, neurodegenerative diseases, and brain tumors. Due to the complexity of the structure and function of the blood-brain barrier, it has been challenging to develop central nervous system drug delivery strategies and reveal critical biological mechanisms. Our previous studies have confirmed that specific mode electroacupuncture stimulation (EA) can effectively open the BBB in rats. Here, we utilized single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) to map the cell population of rat cerebral cortex comprehensively. We identified 23 cell subsets and 8 types of cells in the brain obtained by cell annotation, and explored the potential mechanism of EA to open the blood-brain barrier by bioinformatics analysis of specific cell subsets and cell types, as well as cell communications. In summary, scRNA-seq uncovers the transcriptional changes of the cerebral cortex under EA at the single cell level; our results provide rich insights into the molecular and cellular architecture changes of the brain after EA intervention and provide a new reference for BBB material transport and its drug delivery research in health and disease, providing new potential strategies into the mechanism of BBB opening and provide essential information for designing rational treatment regimens and optimizing drug delivery.",Rattus norvegicus,GSE272895,2024/07/24,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on the blood-brain barrier and electroacupuncture in rats, which is not relevant to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

132,200248382,Enhancing chimeric antigen receptor T cell therapy by modulating the p53 signaling network with Δ133p53α,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell dysfunction is a major barrier to achieving lasting remission in hematologic cancers, especially in chronic lymphocytic leukemia. We have shown previously that Δ133p53α, an endogenous isoform of the human TP53 gene, decreases in expression with age in human T cells, and that reconstitution of Δ133p53α in poorly functional T cells can rescue proliferation. Although Δ133p53α lacks a transactivation domain, it can form heterooligomers with full length p53 and modulate the p53-mediated stress response. Here, we show that constitutive expression of Δ133p53α, potentiates the anti-tumor activity of CD19-directed CAR T cells, and limits dysfunction under conditions of high tumor burden and metabolic stress. We demonstrate that Δ133p53α-expressing CAR T cells exhibit a robust metabolic phenotype, maintaining the ability to execute effector functions and continue proliferating under nutrient limiting conditions, in part due to upregulation of critical biosynthetic processes and improved mitochondrial function. Importantly, we show that our strategy to constitutively express Δ133p53α improves the anti-tumor efficacy of CAR T cells generated from CLL patients that previously failed CAR T cell therapy. More broadly, our results point to the potential role of the p53-mediated stress response in limiting the prolonged antitumor functions required for complete tumor clearance in patients with high disease burden, suggesting that modulation of the p53 signaling network with Δ133p53α may represent a translationally viable strategy for improving CAR T cell therapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE248382,2023/11/27,6.3,6.0,7.0,6.0,"This dataset explores CAR T cell therapy and the role of the p53 signaling network, which is relevant to immunotherapy.

133,200249909,"MCL1 inhibition targets Myeloid Derived Suppressors Cells, promotes antitumor immunity and enhances the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade","Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) are now the first line treatment for patients with advanced melanoma. Despite promising clinical results, many patients fail to respond to these therapies. BH3 mimetics, a novel class of small molecule inhibitors that bind and inhibit anti-apoptotic members of the BCL2 family proteins such as BCL2 or MCL1, have been very successful in treating hematologic malignancies. However, there are limited studies on the immunomodulatory role of the BH3 mimetics. Several factors contribute to ICI resistance including myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) that exert immunosuppressive effects through direct and indirect inhibition of antitumor immunity. Thus, targeting MDSCs to enhance antitumor immunity has the potential to enhance the efficacy of ICIs. In this study, we show that the MCL1 inhibitor S64315 reduces melanoma tumor growth in an immune cell dependent manner in mice. Specifically, S64315 enhances antitumor immunity by reducing MDSC frequency and by promoting the activity of CD8+ T cells. Additionally, human MDSCs are 10 times more sensitive to S64315 than cutaneous melanoma lines. Further, we found that a higher expression of MCL1 is associated with poor survival for patients treated with anti-PD-1. Finally, combining S64315 and anti-PD-1 significantly slowed tumor growth compared to either agent alone. Together, this proof-of-concept study demonstrates the potential of combining MCL1 inhibitor with anti-PD-1 in the treatment of melanoma. It justifies the further development of next generation MCL1 inhibitors to improve efficacy of ICIs in treating malignant melanoma.",Homo sapiens,GSE249909,2024/03/01,6.7,7.0,6.0,7.0,"This dataset discusses MCL1 inhibition and its effects on myeloid-derived suppressor cells, which is relevant to enhancing antitumor immunity.

However, the impact of HRD and related therapies on the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Our study generates single-cell gene expression and T-cell receptor profiles, along with validatory multimodal datasets from > 100 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) samples, primarily from a phase II clinical trial (NCT04507841). Neoadjuvant monotherapy with the PARP inhibitor niraparib achieves impressive 62.5% and 73.6% response rates per RECIST v1.1 and GCIG CA125, respectively. We identify effector regulatory T cells (eTreg) as key responders to HRD and neoadjuvant therapies, co-occurring with other tumor-reactive T cells, particularly terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex). TME-wide interferon signaling correlates with cancer cells upregulating MHC-II and co-inhibitory ligands, potentially driving Treg and Tex fates.

We established baseline transcriptomic profiles of both the large and small airway epithelial cells (referred as LAEC and SAEC, respectively) to identify regional differences irrespective of initiating disease. Methods: We obtained matched primary LAEC and SAEC from lung allograft recipients (n=4, 42.5±4.2 years) and established primary cultures. Bulk RNA sequencing was performed to determine differentially expressed genes. Results: We observed differences in the transcriptional program between LAEC and SAEC Transcription factors (TF) were ranked within the top ten differentially regulated genes. The most abundant TF families included C2H2-ZF, homeobox and bHLH. Upstream regulator analyses identified homeobox genes being significantly in LAEC. Protein-protein interaction network analysis emphasised the role of TFs (ISL1, MSX1, HOXA1, GATA6, ZNF423) in airway modulation. Additionally, functional enrichment analysis revealed the activation of chemotaxis, metalloendipeptidase/metallopeptidase activity and pro-inflammatory signatures (IL17 signalling and RAGE), in LAEC, while SAEC were characterised by elevated expression of surfactant metabolism related genes. Moreover, alveolar and club cells-related genes were expressed in SAEC, suggesting a lower airway-specific signature. Conclusion: Our analysis shows robust transcriptional differences between LAEC and SAEC.

The response of the host to this membrane disruption is poorly understood. In this study, we explore Arabidopsis thaliana's reaction to three distinct viruses that commandeer varying cellular compartments. Our findings reveal autophagy is significantly induced within systemically infected tissues, with autophagy disruption rendering plants highly sensitive to infection. Contrary to being an antiviral defense, quantitative analyses of viral RNA and proteomes establish autophagy as a critical component of the host's tolerance mechanism. Further analysis of mitochondrial hijacking by the Turnip Crinkle Virus has shown that despite perturbing mitochondrial integrity, the virus does not trigger a typical mitophagy response. Instead, viral infection activates a distinct selective autophagy mechanism, where oligomeric metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors and degrade key executors of defense and cell death.

145,200255335,Epigenetic imprinting of H3K4me3 in adipose-derived stem cells by HFS diet consumption leads to a disturbed transcriptomic profile in adipocytes [ChIP-seq],"Adipose tissue metabolism is actively involved in the regulation of energy balance. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) play a critical role in maintaining adipose tissue function through their differentiation into mature adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an obesogenic environment on the epigenetic landscape of ASCs and its impact on adipocyte differentiation and its metabolic consequences. Our results showed that ASCs from mice fed a high-fat sucrose (HFS) diet exhibited reduced adipogenic capacity, increased fat accumulation, and formed larger adipocytes than those from the control group (C). The results showed that ASCs from mice fed the HFS diet had reduced adipogenic capacity. Mitochondrial analysis showed increased mitochondrial activity in undifferentiated ASC-HFS, but decreased respiratory and glycolytic capacity in mature adipocytes. The HFS diet significantly altered the H3K4me3 acetylation profile of ASCs in genes related to adipogenesis, mitochondrial function, inflammatory response and immunomodulation. After differentiation, adipocytes retained H3K4me3 alterations in genes related to inflammatory response and immunomodulation.

Here, we identified that diverse mitochondrial myopathy models elicit a protective mitochondrial integrated stress response (mt-ISR), mediated by OMA1-DELE1 signaling. The response was similar following disruptions in mtDNA maintenance, from knockout of Tfam, and mitochondrial protein unfolding, from disease-causing mutations in CHCHD10 (G58R and S59L). The preponderance of the response was directed at upregulating pathways for aminoacyl-tRNA biosynthesis, the intermediates for protein synthesis, and was similar in heart and skeletal muscle but more limited in brown adipose challenged with cold stress. Strikingly, models with early DELE1 mt-ISR activation failed to grow and survive to adulthood in the absence of Dele1, accounting for some but not all of OMA1’s protection. Notably, the DELE1 mt-ISR did not slow net protein synthesis in stressed striated muscle, but instead prevented loss of translation-associated proteostasis in muscle fibers. Together our findings identify that the DELE1 mt-ISR mediates a stereotyped response to diverse forms of mitochondrial stress and is particularly critical for maintaining growth and survival in early-onset mitochondrial myopathy.

148,200184990,The use of a complex tetra-culture alveolar model to study the toxicological effects of gold nanoparticles with different physicochemical properties,"Purpose: In the last decades, the advancements of nanotechnologies lead to a massive increase of engineered nanoparticles in consumer products, which translates in an increased human and environmental exposure to nanomaterials. For humans, inhalation is considered as the main exposure route to nanomaterials, which is the reason why lung toxicity studies should be considered as a priority. Inhalation studies are often performed in vivo in rodents. Therefore, in vitro models may represent a valid and efficient alternative to predict the acute toxicity effects of inhaled NPs on human health. The model used in this study represents the human alveolar barrier; it is constituted by four different human pulmonary cell lines (EA.hy 296 on the basolateral side; A549, HMC-1 and macrophage-like cells in the apical side). The cells in the apical side were cultivated at the air-liquid-interface (ALI) and they have been exposed to AuNPs with the VitroCell® Cloud System. Results: We describe the effects after 24 hours of exposure to three different gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) in order to evaluate the suitability of our model to assess the toxicological effects of particles. The set of PEGylated AuNPs used included spheres (GNPs), rods (GNRs) and stars (GNSs). The exposure did not cause any significant decrease of viability; all the AuNPs caused cytotoxicity and increase of IL-8 levels at the highest dose. The AuNP were up-taken by the cells in the apical side and they also translocated in the basolateral side. Regarding the global transcript, among differentially expressed genes (DEG) were found genes related to the enhancement of immune cells. Conclusion: AuNPs in the used range of concentrations did not cause severe effects on the co-culture, but different effects were observed for the different types of AuNPs supporting the role of the physico-chemical NP parameters in NP-cell interactions. In addition, our model resulted perfectly suitable to investigate the biological effects of particles especially in terms of inflammatory response and translocation.",Homo sapiens,GSE184990,2022/01/31,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset investigates the toxicological effects of nanoparticles in a lung model, which is somewhat related to lung health.

149,200261799,SFRP2+ CAFs Hinder Abscopal Effect from Combined Radiotherapy and Immunotherapy by Forming a Hostile Perivascular Niche,"Despite accumulating cases of radiotherapy-induced abscopal effect in the lung cancer with the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), the occurrence of this effect remains infrequent and unpredictable to be a therapeutic goal. Here, we showed that the combination of radiotherapy (8Gy*3F) and ICI alleviated the tumor burden at the irradiated site whereas no discernible benefit was observed in the abscopal tumors. RNA-sequencing data showed that extracellular structure organization pathways were enriched in the abscopal tumors after combined therapy, with Sfrp2 being identified as a central hub. SFRP2 expression was observed in cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and was elevated in abscopal tumors after combined therapy. Blockade of SFRP2 followed by combined radiotherapy and ICI reinvigorated infiltration and cytotoxicity of CD8+ T cells, and elicited regression of abscopal tumors, which was abrogated by CD8α depletion. Mechanistically, in vitro experiments demonstrated that SFRP2+ CAFs induced apoptosis of CD8+ T cells. The spatial transcriptome analysis showed that SFRP2+ CAFs were located in proximity to the vessels and surrounded by abundant macrophages and limited CD8Tex, thereby creating an immunosuppressive perivascular niche, which was validated in paraffin sections of human lung cancer. Lineage-tracing assays showed SFRP2+ CAFs were derived from pericytes. IGF-1 released by irradiated tumors facilitated the transition of pericytes into fibroblasts and stimulated the expression of SFRP2. In summary, SFRP2+ CAFs hijack the abscopal effect from combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy via inducing apoptosis of CD8+ T cells and orchestrating a hostile perivascular niche in the lung cancer. Targeting SFRP2+ CAF may recondition the TME and promote the abscopal effect.",Mus musculus,GSE261799,2024/04/01,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,This dataset is extremely relevant as it discusses the role of cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) in the context of lung cancer and their impact on immunotherapy outcomes.

151,200236258,Trametinib sensitizes KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma tumors to PD-1/PD-L1 axis blockade via Id1 downregulation,"The identification of novel therapeutic strategies to overcome the intrinsic or acquired resistance to trametinib in mutant KRAS lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) is a major challenge. This study analyzes the effects of trametinib in Id1, a key factor involved in the oncogenic KRAS pathway, and investigates the Id1 role in acquire resistance and synergy with immunotherapy in KRAS-driven LUAD. Restoring the antitumor immune response by blocking programmed-cell death protein 1 (PD-1) and programmed-cell death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) pathway represents a major breakthrough in non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treatment. Nevertheless, a high proportion of LUAD patients with KRAS alterations remain refractory to this therapy. Material and Methods: To explore whether MEK1/2 inhibition reduces Id1 expression, in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted in KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells and murine models. RNAseq analysis was performed to elucidate the pathways involved in Id1 inhibition. Apoptosis and PD-L1 expression was measured by flow cytometry. Synergy of trametinib combined with anti-PD1 was investigated in KRAS-mutant LUAD mouse models. Results: Using preclinical syngeneic KRAS-mutant lung cancer mouse models, we demonstrate that trametinib synergizes with PD-1 blockade to reduce lung cancer progression and increase mice overall survival. This antitumor activity was linked to the degradation of Id1 via proteasome, and an enhanced INF-Y-mediated PD-L1 tumor cell expression in KRAS-mutant tumor cells. This effect required CD8+ T cells, boosted the intratumoral CD8+/Treg ratio, reducing the intratumoral Treg/CD4+ ratio. Conclusions: Our data may support the role of Id1 in the trametinib antitumoral effect, sustaining the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPK) signaling pathway involved in the trametinib acquired resistance cells and sensitizing KRAS-mutant lung tumors to PD-1 inhibitors, through PD-L1 overexpression.",Mus musculus,GSE236258,2024/05/17,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,This dataset is highly relevant as it investigates the synergy between trametinib and PD-1 blockade in KRAS-mutant lung adenocarcinoma.

152,200155286,SARS-CoV-2 infection is effectively treated and prevented by EIDD-2801,"All coronaviruses known to have recently emerged as human pathogens probably originated in bats1. Here we use a single experimental platform based on immunodeficient mice implanted with human lung tissue (hereafter, human lung-only mice (LoM)) to demonstrate the efficient in vivo replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), as well as two endogenous SARS-like bat coronaviruses that show potential for emergence as human pathogens. Virus replication in this model occurs in bona fide human lung tissue and does not require any type of adaptation of the virus or the host. Our results indicate that bats contain endogenous coronaviruses that are capable of direct transmission to humans. Our detailed analysis of in vivo infection with SARS-CoV-2 in human lung tissue from LoM showed a predominant infection of human lung epithelial cells, including type-2 pneumocytes that are present in alveoli and ciliated airway cells. Acute infection with SARS-CoV-2 was highly cytopathic and induced a robust and sustained type-I interferon and inflammatory cytokine and chemokine response. Finally, we evaluated a therapeutic and pre-exposure prophylaxis strategy for SARS-CoV-2 infection. Our results show that therapeutic and prophylactic administration of EIDD-2801?an oral broad-spectrum antiviral agent that is currently in phase II/III clinical trials?markedly inhibited SARS-CoV-2 replication in vivo, and thus has considerable potential for the prevention and treatment of COVID-19.",Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,GSE155286,2020/09/23,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on SARS-CoV-2 infection and its treatment, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

154,200239436,In vivo multiplexed screen reveals a critical role of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in small cell lung cancer [RNAseq],"Approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases are small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which originates from neuroendocrine cells lining the airways (bronchi) of the lung. SCLC is known for its aggressive nature and swift growth, resulting in a five-year survival rate of around 6%. Understanding the genetic pathways that drive tumor development remains an ongoing challenge. In our study, we employed an in vivo multiplexed approach, known as Tuba-seq, to investigate the impact of the functional loss of 18 putative tumor suppressors. Our screening unveiled Pten and Keap1 as top candidates; knocking out either one promoted both tumor initiation and progression. We identified the Keap1/Cul3/Nrf2 pathway as a pivotal regulator for SCLC development, particularly in regulating the susceptibility of SCLC to ferroptosis.

In this study, we conducted CRISPR knockout screens to identify the pre-mRNA processing factor 19 (PRPF19) as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC. Our findings revealed that PRPF19 is highly expressed in NSCLC, and its expression is negatively correlated with the clinical outcomes. Through functional validation, we confirmed that genetic ablation of PRPF19 significantly attenuated cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered that PRPF19 plays a crucial role in regulating the precise location of Citron Kinase (CIT) within the contractile ring, thereby sustaining the normal cytokinesis processes. Inhibition of PRPF19 resulted in cytokinesis failure, leading to micronuclei formation and activating the anti-tumor immune response through the TBK1-IFNs pathway.

160,200248218,Unique vulnerability of RAC1-mutant melanoma to combined inhibition of CDK9 and immune checkpoints,"RAC1P29S is the third most prevalent hotspot mutation in sun-exposed melanoma. RAC1 alterations in cancer are correlated with poor prognosis, resistance to standard chemotherapy, and insensitivity to targeted inhibitors. Although RAC1P29S mutations in melanoma and RAC1 alterations in several other cancers are increasingly evident, the RAC1-driven biological mechanisms contributing to tumorigenesis remain unclear. Lack of rigorous signaling analysis has prevented identification of alternative therapeutic targets for RAC1P29S-harboring melanomas. To investigate the RAC1P29S-driven effect on downstream molecular signaling pathways, we generated an inducible RAC1P29S expression melanocytic cell line and performed RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) coupled with multiplexed kinase inhibitor beads and mass spectrometry (MIBs/MS) to establish enriched pathways from the genomic to proteomic level. Our proteogenomic analysis identified CDK9 as a potential new and specific target in RAC1P29S-mutant melanoma cells.In vitro, CDK9 inhibition impeded the proliferation of in RAC1P29S-mutant melanoma cells and increased surface expression of PD-L1 and MHC Class I proteins.In vivo, combining CDK9 inhibition with anti-PD-1 immune checkpoint blockade significantly inhibited tumor growthonly in melanomas that expressed the RAC1P29Smutation.

161,200240974,Augmenting CAR T Cell Function with LIGHT,"Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy has shown remarkable clinical success in the treatment of B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL), and multiple myeloma (MM), but its clinical efficacy in other hematologic tumors and solid tumors has been modest. Some of the major challenges that diminish the efficacy of CAR T cells against solid tumors are tumor-associated antigen heterogeneity and the immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). To overcome these problems, we developed CAR T cells overexpress with LIGHT (TNFSF14), which is a ligand of both LtβR (lymphotoxin beta receptor) on cancer cells and HVEM (herpes virus entry mediator) on immune cells. In addition to the cancer cell-directed cytotoxicity mediated by the CAR T cells themselves, the interaction of LIGHT with LTβR on tumor cells led to antigen-independent killing; moreover, LIGHT also provided immunostimulatory properties to the T cells. Hence, LIGHT-CAR T cells promoted, through multimodal and orthogonal mechanisms, an improved antitumor response through enhanced tumor killing and costimulatory potential. The antigen-independent killing of heterogeneous cancer cells was widely applicable across various cancer cell lines and was mediated by LIGHT CAR T cells in an LTβR-dependent manner. In addition, LIGHT-CAR T cells demonstrated higher proliferative capacity and proinflammatory cytokine secretion than non-LIGHT expressing CAR T cells. Furthermore, LIGHT-CAR T cells conferred significant tumor control and concomitant survival benefit as compared to non-LIGHT CAR T cells in xenograft models of solid tumors with a heterogeneous expression of the target antigen. The application of LIGHT-CAR T cell therapies may provide a novel therapeutic approach to the treatment of solid tumors in the context of antigen-heterogeneous disease thereby preventing outgrowth of antigen-negative populations leading to disease relapse.",Homo sapiens,GSE240974,2023/08/16,4.7,6.0,6.0,2.0,"This dataset explores CAR T cell therapy, which is a form of immunotherapy, and its application to solid tumors.

163,200232547,Exploring the Stability of Genomic Imprinting and X-Chromosome Inactivation in the Aged Brain (IMPLICON-Seq),"DNA methylation is a common mechanism regulating monoallelic expression of different genes, including imprinted genes. How age-induced alterations of methylation levels vary across alleles and impact on monoallelic expression is unknown. In the brain, this phenomenon may contribute mechanistically to neuronal dysfunction and disease. In order to investigate the allele-specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of aging, we used key brain areas, hippocampus and cerebellum, of juvenile and old hybrid mice obtained from BL6×CAST reciprocal crosses. We set out to explore whether epigenetic drift affects global DNA methylation machinery by investigating 5- methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels. Mass spectrometry analysis showed a significant increase of 5hmC levels in hippocampus of old mice, but this was not accompanied by measurable differences in methylating or demethylating enzymes. The expression of several repetitive elements (LINEs, SINEs, IAP) was also analysed with a reduction of the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) retrotransposons seen in HCP of old mice. We uncovered the allelic-specific DNA methylation profile of aging using genomic imprinting as a read-out by IMPLICON and allelic-expression by RNA sequencing.

Here, we show that MEF2B C-tail is physiologically phosphorylated at specific residues and phosphorylation at S324 is impaired by lymphoma-associated mutations. Lack of phosphorylation at S324 enhances the interaction of MEF2B with the SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complex, leading to higher transcriptional activity. In addition, these mutants show an increased protein stability due to impaired interaction with the CUL3/KLHL12 ubiquitin complex. Mice expressing a phosphorylation-deficient lymphoma-associated MEF2B mutant display GC enlargement and develop GC-derived lymphomas, when crossed with Bcl2 transgenic mice.

Here, we investigate the effects of KRAS-targeting therapies on the tumor microenvironment using a library of KRASG12D, p53 mutant, murine PDAC-derived cell lines (KPCY) to leverage immune-oncology combination strategies for long-term tumor efficacy. Our findings show that SOS1 and MEK inhibitors (SOS1i+MEKi) suppressed tumor growth in syngeneic models and increased intra-tumoral CD8+ T cells without durable responses. scRNA-sequencing revealed an increase in inflammatory cancer associated fibroblasts (iCAFs), M2 macrophages, and a decreased dendritic cell quality that ultimately resulted in a highly immunosuppressive microenvironment driven by IL6+ iCAFs. Agonist CD40 treatment was effective to revert macrophage polarization and overcome the lack of mature antigen presenting DCs after SOS1i+MEKi therapy.

166,200205305,Interleukin 7 therapy changes tumor immune environment to pro-inflammatory through myeloid and T cell interactions [scRNAseq],"Immune checkpoint inhibitors unleash inhibitory signals on effector T cells inflicted by tumor and surrounding stromal cells. Despite the great success of PD-1 inhibitors in a fraction of cancer patients, lack of checkpoint molecule expression and persistence of immunosuppressive cells limit the effects of the therapy. To overcome the limitations, combination therapies or direct stimulation of myeloid cells are being investigated. Nonetheless, combination therapies increase the incidence of side effects, and a single agent co-stimulating T cell and myeloid populations might be a better strategy. Exploring single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple human cancers and mouse tumor model, we found pleiotropic expression of interleukin 7 receptor on T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Treatment of recombinant IL7 induced expansion of effector CD8 T cells along with pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and dendritic cells.

More recently, instead of AMPK, SIK1 has been strikingly defined as a major player for tumor suppressor liver kinase 1 (LKB1) deficient NSCLC. However, the exact roles and upstream regulators of SIK1 in breast cancer are not well defined.We found that Akt1 can directly phosphorylate SIK1 and inhibit the kinase activity of SIK1, promoting the progress of breast cancer.

169,200228884,Targeting advanced prostate cancer with STEAP1 chimeric antigen receptor T cell and tumor-localized IL-12 immunotherapy [TCR-seq],"Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) is a compelling tumor-associated cell surface antigen for therapeutic targeting in solid tumors. Here, we identified broad expression of STEAP1 relative to the established theranostic target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in a series of lethal metastatic prostate cancers which prompted the development of a STEAP1-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. STEAP1 CAR T cells demonstrated reactivity in low antigen density, antitumor activity across multiple metastatic human and mouse prostate cancer models, and preliminary safety in a human STEAP1 knock-in mouse model. In human-in-mouse and mouse-in-mouse studies, STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy yielded effective tumor responses, but antigen escape was appreciated as a recurrent mechanism of treatment resistance and STEAP1 antigen loss was associated with diminished tumor antigen processing and presentation. The application of tumor-localized interleukin-12 (IL-12) therapy in the form of a collagen binding domain (CBD)-IL-12 fusion protein as an adjunct to STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy enhanced antitumor efficacy by remodeling the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer and combating STEAP1 antigen escape through the engagement of host immunity and epitope spreading. In summary, we describe the extent of STEAP1 expression in treatment-refractory metastatic prostate cancer, characterize a STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy with preclinical evidence of potency and safety, and nominate a combinatorial immunotherapy strategy to overcome barriers to the efficacy of CAR T cell therapy in advanced prostate cancer.",Mus musculus,GSE228884,2023/04/03,3.7,4.0,5.0,2.0,"This dataset investigates STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy in prostate cancer.

170,200254836,Administration of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with increased binding affinity to Fcg receptors during acute SHIV infection shapes innate and adaptive cellular immunity [set2],"Anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have the dual potential of mediating virus neutralization and antiviral effector functions through their Fab and Fc domains, respectively. So far, bNAbs with enhanced Fc effector functions in vitro have only been tested in NHPs during chronic simian-HIV (SHIV) infection. Here, we investigated the effects of administering in acute SHIVAD8-EO infection either wild-type (WT) bNAbs or bNAbs carrying the S239D/I332E/A330L (DEL) mutation, which increases binding to FcgRs. Emergence of plasma and lymph node (LN) virus was delayed in bNAb-treated monkeys and occurred earlier in monkeys given DEL bNAbs than in those given WT bNAbs, consistent with faster clearance of DEL bNAbs from plasma. DEL bNAb-treated monkeys had higher levels of circulating virus-specific IFNg single-producing and IFNg/MIP-1b double-producing CD8+ CD69+ T cells than the other groups. In LNs, WT bNAbs were evenly distributed between follicular and extrafollicular areas, but DEL bNAbs predominated in the latter. At week 8 post-challenge, LN monocytes and NK cells from DEL bNAb-treated monkeys upregulated proinflammatory signaling pathways and LN T cells downregulated TNF signaling via NF-kB. Overall, bNAbs with increased binding affinity to FcgRs shaped innate and adaptive cellular immunity, which may be important to consider in future strategies of passive bNAb therapy.",Macaca mulatta,GSE254836,2024/07/23,1.3,2.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset examines mechanisms of resistance in acute lymphoblastic leukemia, which is unrelated to lung cancer.

171,200261367,FLASH proton radiotherapy mitigates inflammatory and fibrotic pathways and preserves cardiac function in a preclinical mouse model of radiation-induced heart disease,"Purpose: Studies during the past 9 years suggest that delivering radiation at dose rates exceeding 40 Gy/s, known as “FLASH” radiotherapy, enhances the therapeutic index of radiation therapy (RT) by decreasing normal tissue damage while maintaining tumor response compared to conventional (or standard) RT. This study demonstrates the cardioprotective benefits of FLASH proton RT (F-PRT) compared to standard (conventional) proton RT (S-PRT), as evidenced by reduced acute and chronic cardiac toxicities. Methods and Materials: Mice were imaged using cone beam computed tomography to precisely determine the heart’s apex as the beam isocenter. Irradiation was conducted utilizing a shoot-through technique with a 5mm collimator. Bulk RNA-sequencing was performed on non-irradiated (NR) samples, as well as apexes treated with F-PRT or S-PRT, at 2 weeks following a single 40 Gy dose. Inflammatory responses were assessed through multiplex cytokine/chemokine microbead assay and immunofluorescence analyses. Levels of perivascular fibrosis were quantified using Masson’s Trichrome and Picrosirius red staining. Additionally, cardiac tissue functionality was evaluated by 2D echocardiograms at 8 and 30 weeks post-PRT. Results: Radiation damage was specifically localized in the heart’s apex. RNA profiling of cardiac tissues treated with PRT revealed that S-PRT induced unique pathways associated with DNA damage response, induction of tumor necrosis factor superfamily and inflammatory response, while F-PRT primarily affected cytoplasmic translation, mitochondrion organization and ATP synthesis. Notably, F-PRT led to a milder inflammatory response, accompanied by significantly attenuated changes in TGF-1 and SMA levels. Critically, F-PRT decreased collagen deposition, and better preserved cardiac functionality compared to S-PRT. Conclusions: This study demonstrated that F-PRT reduces the induction of an inflammatory environment with lower expression of inflammatory cytokines and profibrotic factors. Importantly, the results indicate that F-PRT better preserves cardiac functionality, as confirmed by echocardiography analysis, while also mitigating the development of long-term fibrosis.",Mus musculus,GSE261367,2024/07/11,,,,,,,
172,200236384,Dysfunctional tumor-infiltrating Vδ1+ T lymphocytes in MSS colorectal cancer,"Impairment and exhaustion of effector functions limiting a proper immune response have been reported for conventional T cells in chronic infection and cancer. However, the functional relevance of γδ T cells influenced by the tumor microenvironment in human colorectal cancer (CRC) is still unclear. Here, we identify and characterize a distinct population of Vδ1+ T cells in human microsatellite stable CRC. Using integrated gene expression analysis and ⍺β/γδ-T cell receptor sequencing, we demonstrate activated adaptive immune responses in Vδ1+ T cells in CRC, which are accompanied by perturbances of innate immunity. However, enhanced upregulation of exhaustion genes, altered effector and cell stress molecules in Vδ1+ T cells pinpoint to impaired γδ T cells in CRC compared to distant healthy colon. Cellular interaction analysis highlights a role of cancer-associated fibroblasts in the dysregulation of Vδ1+ T cells in CRC. Immunophenotyping identified a distinct population of Vδ1+ T cells which dominates the γδ T cell subsets and displays a functionally impaired phenotype with a potential to be restored in vitro. These results define pathways operative in γδ T cells in CRC and provide a roadmap for harnessing γδ T cells for specific immunotherapeutic strategies.",Homo sapiens,GSE236384,2024/07/11,,,,,,,

174,200270961,Targeting Immune-Fibroblast Crosstalk in Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Fibrosis VI,"Inflammation and tissue fibrosis co-exist and are causally linked to organ dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms driving immune-fibroblast crosstalk in human cardiac disease remains unexplored, and there are currently no approved treatments that directly target cardiac fibrosis. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping, and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 donors, acutely infarcted, and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory marked by cell surface expression of fibroblast activator protein (FAP), which diverged into distinct myofibroblasts and pro-fibrotic fibroblast populations, the latter resembling matrifibrocytes. We lineage traced FAP fibroblasts in vivo and showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model tissue fibrosis and demonstrated that 3 different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared to cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand-receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) signaling drove the emergence of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts, the IL-1β ligand in CCR2 monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signaling using a monoclonal antibody and showed fewer pro-fibrotic fibroblasts, decreased cardiac fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. Herein, we characterize fibroblast lineage diversification in the failing heart and showed a subset of macrophages signal to fibroblasts via IL-1β and rewire their gene regulatory network and differentiation trajectory towards a pro-fibrotic fibroblast phenotype. These findings highlight the broader therapeutic potential of targeting inflammation to treat tissue fibrosis and preserve organ function.",Mus musculus,GSE270961,2024/07/01,,,,,,,
175,200230868,Expression of the membrane tetraspanin claudin 18 on cancer cells promotes T lymphocyte infiltration and antitumor immunity in pancreatic cancer,"Tumors weakly infiltrated by T lymphocytes poorly respond to immunotherapy. We aimed to unveil malignancy-associated programs regulating T cell entrance, arrest, and activation in the tumor environment. Differential expression of cell adhesion and tissue architecture programs, particularly the presence of the membrane tetraspanin claudin (CLDN)18 as a signature gene, demarcated immune-infiltrated from immune-depleted mouse pancreatic tumors. In human pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and non-small cell lung cancer, CLDN18 expression positively correlated with more differentiated histology and favorable prognosis. CLDN18 on the cell surface promoted accrual of cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs), facilitating direct CTL contacts with tumor cells by driving the mobilization of the adhesion protein ALCAM to the lipid rafts of the tumor cell membrane through actin. This process favored the formation of robust immunological synapses (ISs) between CTLs and CLDN18-positive cancer cells, resulting in increased T cell activation. Our data reveal an immune role for CLDN18 in orchestrating T cell infiltration and shaping the tumor immune contexture.",Mus musculus,GSE230868,2024/05/14,,,,,,,
176,200245284,Venetoclax Resistant Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia is characterized by Increased Mitochondrial Activity and Can Be Overcome by Co-targeting Oxidative Phosphorylation,"Deregulated apoptosis signaling is characteristic for many cancers and contributes to leukemogenesis and treatment failure in B-cell precursor acute lymphoblastic leukemia (BCP-ALL). Apoptosis is controlled by different pro- and anti-apoptotic molecules. Inhibition of anti-apoptotic molecules like B-cell lymphoma 2 (BCL-2) has been developed as therapeutic strategy. Venetoclax (VEN), a selective BCL-2 inhibitor has shown clinical activity in different lymphoid malignancies and is currently evaluated in first clinical trials in BCP-ALL. However, insensitivity to VEN has been described constituting a major clinical concern. Here, we addressed and modeled VEN-resistance in BCP-ALL, investigated the underlying mechanisms in cell lines and patient-derived xenograft (PDX) samples and identified potential strategies to overcome VEN-insensitivity. Leukemia lines with VEN-specific resistance were generated in vitro and further characterized using RNA-seq analysis. Interestingly, gene sets annotated to the citric/tricarboxylic acid cycle and the respiratory electron transport chain were significantly enriched and upregulated, indicating increased mitochondrial metabolism in VEN-resistant ALL. Metabolic profiling showed sustained high mitochondrial metabolism in VEN-resistant lines as compared to control lines. Adccordingly, primary PDX-ALL samples with intrinsic VEN-insensitivity showed higher oxygen consumption and ATP production rates, further highlighting that increased mitochondrial activity is a characteristic feature of VEN-resistant ALL. VEN-resistant PDX-ALL showed significant higher mitochondrial DNA content and differed in mitochondria morphology with significantly larger and elongated structures, further corroborating our finding of augmented mitochondrial metabolism upon VEN-resistance. Using oligomycin, an inhibitor of the complex V/ATPase subunit, we found synergistic activity and apoptosis induction in VEN-resistant BCP-ALL cell lines and PDX samples, demonstrating that acquired and intrinsic VEN-insensitivity can be overcome by co-targeting BCL-2 and the OxPhos pathway. These findings of reprogrammed, high mitochondrial metabolism in VEN-resistance and synergistic activity upon co-targeting BCL-2 and oxidative phosphorylation, strongly suggest further preclinical and potential clinical evaluation in VEN-resistant BCP-ALL.",Homo sapiens,GSE245284,2024/07/04,,,,,,,
177,200269601,COL10A1 expression distinguishes a subset of cancer-associated fibroblasts present in the stroma of high-risk basal cell carcinoma,"Basal cell carcinoma (BCC) is the most frequently diagnosed skin cancer and the most common malignancy in humans. Different morphological subtypes of BCC are associated with low- or high-risk of recurrence and aggressiveness, but the underlying biology of how the individual subtypes arise remains largely unknown. Because the majority of BCCs appear to arise from mutations in the same pathway, we hypothesized that BCC development, growth and invasive potential is also influenced by the tumor microenvironment and in particular by cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) and their secreted factors. In this work, we aimed to characterize the stroma of the different BCC subtypes with a focus on CAF populations. To investigate the stromal features of the different BCC subtypes, we applied laser-capture microdissection (LCM) followed by RNA sequencing. A cohort of 15 BCC samples from 5 different “pure” subtypes (superficial, nodular, micronodular, sclerosing and basosquamous; n=3 each) were selected and included in the analysis. Healthy skin was used as a control (n=6). We show that the stroma of the different BCC subtypes have distinct gene expression signatures. Nodular and micronodular seem to have the most similar signatures, while superficial and sclerosing the most different. By comparing low- and high-risk BCC subtypes, we observed that Collagen 10A1 (COL10A1) is overexpressed in the stroma of sclerosing/infiltrative and basosquamous but not micronodular high-risk subtypes. Those findings were confirmed by immunohistochemistry in a cohort of 89 different BCC and 13 healthy skin samples. Moreover, scRNAseq analysis of BCCs of two independent datasets showed that the COL10A1-expressing population of cells is associated with the stroma adjacent to invasive BCC and shows extracellular matrix remodeling features.",Homo sapiens,GSE269601,2024/07/02,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on cancer-associated fibroblasts in basal cell carcinoma, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in very low relevance.","This dataset examines cancer-associated fibroblasts in basal cell carcinoma, which is not related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

178,200270912,Context-dependent roles for autophagy in myeloid cells in tumor progression [Atg5_Pymt],"Autophagy is known to suppress tumor initiation by removing genotoxic stresses in normal cells. Conversely, autophagy is also known to support tumor progression by alleviating metabolic stresses in neoplastic cells. Centered on this pro-tumor role of autophagy, there have been many clinical trials to treat cancers through systemic blocking of autophagy. Such systemic inhibition affects both tumor cells and non-tumor cells, and the consequence of blocked autophagy in non-tumor cells in the context of tumor microenvironment is relatively understudied. Here, we examined the effect of autophagy-deficient myeloid cells on the progression of autophagy-competent tumors. We found that blocking autophagy only in myeloid cells modulated tumor progression markedly but such effects were context dependent. In a tumor implantation model, the growth of implanted tumor cells was substantially reduced in mice with autophagy-deficient myeloid cells; T cells infiltrated deeper into the tumors and were responsible for the reduced growth of the implanted tumor cells. In an oncogene-driven tumor induction model, however, tumors grew faster and metastasized more in mice with autophagy-deficient myeloid cells. These data demonstrate that the autophagy status of myeloid cells plays a critical role in tumor progression, promoting or suppressing tumor growth depending on the context of tumor-myeloid cell interactions. This study indicates that systemic use of autophagy inhibitors in cancer therapy may have differential effects on rates of tumor progression in patients due to effects on myeloid cells and that this warrants more targeted use of selective autophagy inhibitors in a cancer therapy in a clinical setting.",Mus musculus,GSE270912,2024/07/02,1.7,3.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates the role of autophagy in myeloid cells in tumor progression.

We found a cell-to-cell communication system in fission yeast that inactivates NCR and enables cells to take up leucine even on high NH4+ medium (referred to as adaptive growth). Furthermore, we identified novel oxylipins responsible for the adaptive growth, which are secreted from cells and are referred to as nitrogen signaling factors (NSF). RNA-seq analyses showed that mitochondrial respiratory-related genes are differentially expressed upon addition of synthetic NSF.

However, enhancing antitumor T cell response inevitably confers an increased risk of cytokine release syndrome associated with monocyte-derived IL-6 secretion. Thus, a novel approach to simultaneously enhance therapeutic efficacy and safety is warranted. In this study, we developed a chimeric cytokine receptor composed of the extracellular domains of GP130 and IL6RA linked to the transmembrane and cytoplasmic domain of IL-7R mutant that constitutively activate JAK-STAT pathway (G6/7R). CAR-T cells with G6/7R efficiently absorbed and degraded monocyte-derived IL-6 both in vitro and in vivo.

182,200240980,"Cellular fitness of MYC-driven cancer cells to genetic and pharmacologic perturbations in normoxia, hypoxia and 3D","MYC and hypoxia gene clusters are the two most commonly recurring transcriptional programs in heterogenous tumors. Understanding the cellular fitness of MYC-driven cancer cells in normoxia and hypoxia may lead to identification of distinct cancer cell vulnerabilities. Using genome-wide CRISPR screenings of MYC-driven liver cancer cells cultured over 4 weeks in 21% and 1% oxygen in monolayer, and 21% oxygen in 3D spheroid, we not only identify over 600 essential genes under all three conditions but also context-specific fitness genes and pathways. Knockout of VHL-HIF1 pathway results in incompatible fitness defects under 21% oxygen versus 1% oxygen or 3D. Genetic deletion of each of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I-V has distinct cellular fitness outcomes. Notably, the organogenesis signaling pathways such as TGF-SMAD specifically limits the uncontrolled cell proliferation of 3D spheroids while inactivation of epigenetic modifiers (Bcor, Kmt2d, Mettl3 and Mettl14) has opposite outcomes in monolayer versus 3D. We also discover distinct metabolic requirement for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in three conditions.

183,200251937,In situ targeted gene expression analysis of Marjolin ulcers,"Marjolin's ulcer is a a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy that can arise on previously injured skin, established scars, and chronic non-healing wounds. It is most often found in burn scars, but it can also occur in other types of wounds, including venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, and vaccination sites. The most common histological type of Marjolin’s ulcers is squamous cell carcinoma, however basal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and sarcomas have also been reported. All parts of the body could potentially be affected yet the lower extremities are the anatomic sites most commonly involved. While SCCs commonly have a metastasis rate of 0.5 to 3.0 percent, those arising from burn scars metastasize at a rate in excess of 30 percent. The 5-year survival after a diagnosis of Marjolin’s ulcer was found to be 50 percent. The transformation to a malignancy can occur either chronically, over a period of more than 35 years, or occasionally within a year of the original injury. The exact mechanism of this transformation is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to chronic keratinocyte dysfunction during the healing process of severe burn wounds. Surgical excision is the main treatment for Marjolin's ulcer and provides the best chance of survival. In a previous study, we investigated the bulk transcriptional changes that lead to Marjolin's ulcer by comparing global gene expression changes between squamous cells present in a squamous cell carcinoma versus those present within Marjolin's ulcer (MU) (Sinha et. al.

185,200211620,The effects of adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells intranasal administration on the house dust mite-induced mixed airway inflammation in an experimental asthma model,"The beneficial effects of mesenchymal stem cell administration have been reported in numerous preclinical studies. Briefly, decreased levels of Th2-related cytokines, namely IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13, impaired eosinophils infiltration, and mucus secretion within the lung have been recognized as hallmarks of MSC-mediated immunosuppression in OVA-Alumn- induced experimental model. However, to date, the effects of MSCs transfer on mixed airway inflammation remain elusive. Therefore, here we aimed to investigate the influence of internasal adipose tissue-derived MSCs on mixed inflammation in a house dust mite (HDM) extract-induced experimental asthma model. To induce mixed airway inflammation, mice were challenged with 10 g of HDM extract for 5 days each week. Additionally, to investigate the short- and long-term effects, adipose tissue-derived MSCs were administrated at two-time points. To analyze MSC-mediated changes, we assessed lung morphology, frequencies of T cells effectors, epithelial barrier integrity, lung transcriptomic profiles, and the levels of cytokines and chemokine in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL). We observed the limitation of cellular infiltration and mucus production after MSCs administration. Moreover, we noted a trend to decrease in the frequencies of T cells producing IL-4 and IFNy as a long-term effect of MSCs administration. Additionally, the expression of ZO-1 was increased in both analyzed time-points of MSCs transfer. Notably, we found the changes in the transcriptomic profiles reflecting, the inflammation of the respiratory system, the proliferation of lymphocytes, migration of leukocytes, and recruitment of neutrophils and eosinophils. Finally, we also noted the differences in the levels of CXCL and CCL chemokines in BAL between short- and long-term models, while the changes in Th2-related cytokines levels were limited. Overall, here we confirmed the therapeutic potential of adipose tissue-derived MSCs administration in a novel HDM extract-induced experimental model of mixed airway inflammation.",Mus musculus,GSE211620,2024/07/19,5.7,5.0,5.0,7.0,"This dataset investigates the effects of mesenchymal stem cells on airway inflammation, which is relevant to lung health.

186,200251676,Antibiotic Susceptibility Influenced by Carbon Source in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,"Antibiotic therapy causes changes in bacterial abundance and metabolism within the gut microbiome. These changes can lead to complications in the host such as microbiome dysbiosis and opportunistic infections. Additionally, increasing multidrug resistance causes significant morbidity and mortality in patients with bacterial infections. Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron (Bth) is both a normal commensal in the gut and an opportunistic pathogen in other body sites. Our lab has shown that -lactam treatment in mice decimates nearly all gut bacterial species except Bth, which experiences a bloom. We propose that in the gut, Bth enters a protected state linked to metabolic changes such as an increase in stress response and polysaccharide fermentation, and a decrease in hexose utilization. Bth is also protected from -lactams in vitro when grown on fiber as opposed to glucose. The goal of this project is to understand what mechanism is responsible for this polysaccharide-mediated tolerance (PM-tolerance). Studies of other bacteria show that an increase in respiratory metabolism independent of growth rate promotes susceptibility to bactericidal antibiotics. Bth has a diverse array of metabolic machinery including an electron transport chain (ETC) that works under anaerobic or microaerobic conditions. Transcriptional analysis of Bth treated with the -lactam amoxicillin revealed a decrease in ETC enzyme expression when given fiber vs glucose. We found that knocking out different ETC enzymes alters the PM-tolerance phenotype in vitro. Thus, it appears that respiratory capacity is linked to -lactam susceptibility in Bth. This work improves upon our understanding of bacterial tolerance strategies and could help identify future therapeutic targets to combat multidrug resistance.",Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron VPI-5482,GSE251676,2024/07/20,0.7,0.0,1.0,1.0,This dataset focuses on antibiotic susceptibility in Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Three-dimensional in vitro human distal lung culture systems would strongly facilitate investigation of pathologies including interstitial lung disease, cancer, and SARS-CoV-2-associated COVID-19 pneumonia. We generated long-term feeder-free, chemically-defined culture of distal lung progenitors as organoids derived from single adult human alveolar epithelial type II (AT2) or KRT5+ basal cells. AT2 organoids exhibited AT1 transdifferentiation potential while basal cell organoids developed lumens lined by differentiated club and ciliated cells. Single cell analysis of basal organoid KRT5+ cells revealed a distinct ITGA6+ITGB4+ mitotic population whose proliferation further segregated to a TNFRSF12Ahi subfraction comprising ~10% of KRT5+ basal cells, residing in clusters within terminal bronchioles and exhibiting enriched clonogenic organoid growth activity. Distal lung organoids were created with apical-out polarity to display ACE2 on the exposed external surface, facilitating SARS-CoV-2 infection of AT2 and basal cultures and identifying club cells as a novel target population.

ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity—as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

190,200210206,Single cell transcriptomics reveals distinct transcriptional responses to oxycodone and buprenorphine by iPSC-derived brain organoids from patients with opioid use disorder,"The opioid epidemic represents a national crisis. Oxycodone is one of the most prescribed opioid medications in the United States, whereas buprenorphine is currently the most prescribed medication for opioid use disorder (OUD) pharmacotherapy. Given the extensive use of prescription opioids and the global opioid epidemic, it is essential to understand how opioids modulate brain cell type function at the single-cell level. We performed single nucleus RNA-seq (snRNA-seq) using iPSC-derived forebrain organoids from three male OUD subjects in response to oxycodone, buprenorphine, or vehicle for seven days. We utilized the snRNA-seq data to identify differentially expressed genes following drug treatment using the Seurat integrative analysis pipeline. We utilized iPSC-derived forebrain organoids and single-cell sequencing technology as an unbiased tool to study cell-type-specific and drug-specific transcriptional responses. After quality control filtering, we analyzed 25787 cells and identified sixteen clusters using unsupervised clustering analysis. Our results reveal distinct transcriptional responses to oxycodone and buprenorphine by iPSC-derived brain organoids from patients with OUD. Specifically, buprenorphine displayed a significant influence on transcription regulation in glial cells. However, oxycodone induced type I interferon signaling in many cell types, including neural cells in brain organoids. Finally, we demonstrate that oxycodone, but not buprenorphine activated STAT1 and induced the type I interferon signaling in patients with OUD. These data suggest that elevation of STAT1 expression associated with OUD might play a role in transcriptional regulation in response to oxycodone.

192,200244103,Targeting DHX9 triggers interferon response and replication stress in Small Cell Lung Cancer [RNA-seq],"Activating innate immunity in cancer cells through cytoplasmic nucleic acid sensing pathways, a phenomenon known as “viral mimicry”, has emerged as an effective strategy to convert immunologically “cold” tumors into “hot”. Through a curated CRISPR-based screen of RNA Helicases, we identified DExD/H-box helicase 9 (DHX9) as a potent repressor of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in small cell lung cancers (SCLCs). Depletion of DHX9 induced accumulation of cytoplasmic dsRNA and triggered tumor-intrinsic innate immunity. Intriguingly, ablating DHX9 also induced aberrant accumulation of R-loops, which resulted in an increase of DNA damage-derived cytoplasmic DNA and replication stress in SCLCs. In vivo, DHX9 deletion promoted decrease in tumor growth while inducing a more immunogenic tumor microenvironment, invigorating responsiveness to immune checkpoint blockade. These findings suggest that DHX9 is a crucial repressor of tumor-intrinsic innate immunity and replication stress, representing a promising target for SCLC and other “cold” tumors where genomic instability contribute to pathology.",Homo sapiens,GSE244103,2024/02/01,9.3,9.0,9.0,10.0,This dataset investigates the role of DHX9 in small cell lung cancer and its implications for immunotherapy.

The pathogenesis of irMyocarditis and its relationship to anti-tumor immunity remain poorly understood. We sought to define how immune cell trafficking between heart, tumor and blood contributes to irMyocarditis pathogenesis and fatality by leveraging single-cell (sc)RNA-seq coupled with T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing, microscopy, and proteomics analysis of 28 irMyocarditis patients and 23 controls. Our analysis of ~284,360 cells from the heart and blood specimens identified enrichment of cytotoxic T-cell subsets, inflammatory macrophage subsets, conventional dendritic cells (cDCs), and fibroblasts in the heart that accompany the upregulation of potentially targetable, pro-inflammatory transcriptional programs. Expanded TCR clones enriched in irMyocarditis are largely distinct from those in paired tumors, suggesting distinct mechanisms between anti-tumor immune response and irMyocarditis. We also identified circulating biomarkers of fatality, including decreased circulating CD4+ T cells, decreased cDCs, and the presence of cardiac-expanded TCRs in a circulating, cycling CD8+ T cell population.

Unfortunately, the accurate manipulation of exosomes by controlling their biodistribution still poses significant challenges. Here we overcome this limitation by developing an externally controlled delivery system for primed ANXA1 myo-exosomes (Exomyo). Effective nanocarriers are realized by immobilizing the Exomyo onto ferromagnetic nanotubes (NT-MAG) to achieve a controlled delivery and localization of Exomyo into skeletal muscles by an applied external magnetic field. Quantitative muscle-level analyses revealed that macrophages dominate the uptake of Exomyo from NT-MAG in vivo, to synergistically promote beneficial muscle responses in a murine animal model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) thanks to the successful localization of therapeutic Exomyo upon systemic injection. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of exosome-based therapies for muscle diseases and in general highlight the formulation of effective functional nanocarriers aimed at optimizing exosome biodistribution.",Mus musculus,GSE263456,2024/07/23,0.7,0.0,1.0,1.0,This dataset focuses on exosome delivery in muscle diseases and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

197,200264426,Intermittent MEK inhibition with GITR co-stimulation rescues T cell function for increased efficacy with CTLA-4 blockade in solid tumor models,"MEK inhibitors (MEKis) have limited success with MAPK/ERK pathway dependent cancers due to various resistance mechanisms tumor cells can employ. CH5126766 (CKI27) is a novel inhibitor that binds to MEK and prevents release of RAF, reducing the relief of negative feedback commonly observed with other MEKis. We observed that CKI27 increased MHC expression on tumor cells and improved T cell mediated killing. Yet, CKI27 also decreased T cell proliferation, activation, and cytolytic activity by inhibiting the MAPK/ERK pathway that is activated downstream of T cell receptor signaling. Therefore, we aimed to balance the positive and negative immunomodulatory effects of MEKis for optimal combination with immunotherapy. Intermittent administration of CKI27 allowed T cells to partially recover and co-stimulation via GITR and OX-40 agonist antibodies completely alleviated inhibition of function. In Kras mutant lung and colon tumor mouse models, intermittent CKI27 and anti-GITR significantly decreased tumor growth and prolonged survival when further combined with CTLA-4 immune checkpoint blockade. Moreover, this triple combination increased CD8+ and CD4+ T cell proliferation, activation, and effector/memory subsets in the tumor draining lymph nodes and tumors and led to intra-tumoral Treg destabilization. These data, collectively, will allow for more informed decisions when optimizing combination regimens by overcoming resistance, reducing toxicity, and generating long-term immune responses.",Mus musculus,GSE264426,2024/06/12,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,"This dataset investigates the effects of MEK inhibition and T cell function in solid tumor models, including lung cancer.

199,200240758,A plasma miRNA-based classifier for small cell lung cancer diagnosis [NanoString],"Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

200,200242053,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment[scRNA-seq_1],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE242053,2024/02/02,7.0,7.0,7.0,7.0,"This dataset focuses on T cell exhaustion and the role of NR4a deletion in enhancing T cell function, which is relevant to immunotherapy strategies for lung cancer.

202,200247465,Analysis of the transcriptomic profiles for HER2 CD8+ CAR T cells cultured under short-term resting conditions.,"T cell exhaustion and metabolic dysfunction induced by chronic antigen stimulation within the tumor microenvironment represent formidable obstacles in CAR T cell therapy for solid tumors. Previously, we developed a method to convert effector/exhausted CAR T cells that emerge from repeated antigen stimulation into stem cell memory-like CAR T (termed CAR-iTSCM) cells. These CAR-iTSCM cells exhibit expression of early memory markers and enhanced mitochondrial metabolism after quiescence under culture conditions containing IL-7, CXCL12, and the NOTCH-ligand. However, we noticed that this strategy was effective for CD19 CAR used for blood cancers, but not for HER2 CAR commonly used to treat solid tumors, due to tonic CAR signals. In this study, we developed a new culture condition for CAR iTSCM cells suitable for HER2 CAR and elucidated the mechanism of induction of stemness and mitochondrial fitness. We found that short-term resting condition with IL-7, CXCL12, and pan-tyrosine kinase inhibitor, Dasatinib can induce stem-like CAR T cells at the epigenetic level and enhance mitochondrial metabolism. We identified FOXO1 as a critical regulator in the process of epigenetic and metabolic reprogramming, and anti-tumor activity. We found that overexpression of FOXO1 leads to enhanced mitochondrial metabolism, efficient CAR T cell expansion, and potent anti-tumor effects through epigenetic modifications. These findings suggest that regulating the transcriptional activity of FOXO1 is a promising strategy for engineering effective CAR T cells for treating solid tumors. In this analysis, we aimed to investigate the effects of the resting conditions (IL-7+CXCL12+IGF-I +Dasatinib) on the transcriptomic profiles in 4-1BB-based HER2 CD8+ CAR T cells which exhibit tonic signals-induced exhaustion hallmarks.",Homo sapiens,GSE247465,2023/11/21,8.3,9.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset explores CAR T cell therapy, specifically focusing on HER2 CD8+ CAR T cells and their potential for treating solid tumors, including lung cancer.

Here, we analyzed the human MC/Teff cells interplay through the application of RNAseq and functional assays and showed that activated Teff cells induced a specific transcriptomic program in MCs driving them toward an inflammatory phenotype. Teff cells affected key MC immune functions as they induced prostaglandin, inflammatory cytokines and chemokines production and fostered FceRI-dependent degranulation. Moreover, Teff cell induced in MCs the capacity to regulate T cell responses through a wide-range of dedicated soluble and membrane ligands.

208,200254781,Administration of anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies with increased binding affinity to Fcg receptors during acute SHIV infection shapes innate and adaptive cellular immunity [set1],"Anti-HIV-1 broadly neutralizing antibodies (bNAbs) have the dual potential of mediating virus neutralization and antiviral effector functions through their Fab and Fc domains, respectively. So far, bNAbs with enhanced Fc effector functions in vitro have only been tested in NHPs during chronic simian-HIV (SHIV) infection. Here, we investigated the effects of administering in acute SHIVAD8-EO infection either wild-type (WT) bNAbs or bNAbs carrying the S239D/I332E/A330L (DEL) mutation, which increases binding to FcgRs. Emergence of plasma and lymph node (LN) virus was delayed in bNAb-treated monkeys and occurred earlier in monkeys given DEL bNAbs than in those given WT bNAbs, consistent with faster clearance of DEL bNAbs from plasma. DEL bNAb-treated monkeys had higher levels of circulating virus-specific IFNg single-producing and IFNg/MIP-1b double-producing CD8+ CD69+ T cells than the other groups. In LNs, WT bNAbs were evenly distributed between follicular and extrafollicular areas, but DEL bNAbs predominated in the latter. At week 8 post-challenge, LN monocytes and NK cells from DEL bNAb-treated monkeys upregulated proinflammatory signaling pathways and LN T cells downregulated TNF signaling via NF-kB. Overall, bNAbs with increased binding affinity to FcgRs shaped innate and adaptive cellular immunity, which may be important to consider in future strategies of passive bNAb therapy.",Macaca mulatta,GSE254781,2024/07/23,1.3,2.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates anti-HIV-1 antibodies and their effects on cellular immunity, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

210,200267158,Sculpting the tumour microenvironment by combining radiotherapy and ATR inhibition for curative-intent adjuvant immunotherapy,"Results of combining radiotherapy/chemoradiotherapy and immune checkpoint blockade have been disappointing in patients with locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). For such a potentially radiocurable disease, there remains an imperative to explore novel combination approaches. Here, we show that combining ATR inhibition with radiotherapy (ATRi/RT) increases the frequency of activated NKG2A/PD-1 double-positive T cells in animal models of HNSCC. Addition of dual anti-NKG2A/-PD-L1 blockade to ATRi/RT in the adjuvant, post-radiotherapy setting induces a robust antitumour response. Efficacy of the combination relies on CD40/CD40L costimulatory-mediated infiltration of activated/proliferative/memory CD8 and CD4 T cells with persistent or new T cell receptor (TCR) signalling, respectively. In this favourable therapeutic context, we reveal increased richness of the TCR repertoire and the emergence of numerous and large TCR clusters that share antigen specificity in response to combination therapy.

211,200187438,Factors contributing to Chimeric Antigen Receptor T-cell Therapy efficacy in pediatric oncology patients,"Immune cell populations are composed of multiple cell types and their functions are tightly connected through their interactions. Cancer immunotherapy enhances the immune system’s ability to recognize and fight cancer and diminish cancer’s ability to evade the immune system.

Problems with CAR-T therapy include relapse due to loss of persistence of CAR-T cells and loss of CD19 expression on leukemia cells. The mechanisms of CAR-T failure need to be elucidated and exploring these mechanisms will identify potential treatment options and improve outcomes. Utilizing single-cell RNA seq (scRNA-seq), we investigated the interactions between CAR-T cells and the immune cells in pediatric ALL patients who’ve received CAR-T therapy.

214,200245913,Transcriptome Profiling and Characterization of Peritoneal Metastasis Ovarian Cancer Xenografts in Humanized Mice,"Background: Although immunotherapy has not yet been as successful in ovarian cancer (OC), it remains a potential therapeutic strategy. Preclinical models of OC are necessary to evaluate the efficacy of immuno-oncology (IO) drugs targeting human cancer and immune components but have been underutilized. Developing mouse models with a humanized (Hu) immune system can help understand the human immune response to IO drugs, including immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), which have demonstrated limited effectiveness in OC patients. Methods: We established OC xenograft Hu-mouse models by intraperitoneally injecting luciferase-expressing SKOV-3 Luc and OVCAR-3 Luc OC cells into CD34+ Hu-mice. Tumor growth was monitored through bioluminescence imaging (BLI). We assessed the efficacy of PD-1 blockade with pembrolizumab in the SKOV-3 Luc Hu-mouse model. The immune profiles of the tumors were characterized using colorimetric immunostaining and flow cytometry. Additionally, we analyzed RNA-seq data to investigate the gene expression signature of pembrolizumab refractory tumors. Results: We confirmed tumor development in both OC cell lines within CD34+ Hu-mice. In these models, human lymphocyte and myeloid cell subsets were present in the tumors, draining lymph nodes, blood, and spleens. The SKOV-3 Luc tumor-bearing Hu-mice did not respond to pembrolizumab monotherapy. These tumors exhibited a high presence of tumor-infiltrating macrophages. Tumors in Hu-mice unresponsive to pembrolizumab showed a lower abundance of CD8+ T-cells, memory B cells, plasma cells, and a higher proportion of naïve M0 macrophages and mast cells compared to the PBS control. Furthermore, we identified 43 significantly enriched gene sets in these tumors. The differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were predominantly enriched in HDAC class I, RB1, KLF1/3, TCF21, MYD88, SMARCE1 target genes, and genes associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and fibroblasts.

215,200262765,"The Clinical Significance of CRNDE Gene Methylation, Polymorphisms, and CRNDEP Micropeptide Expression in Ovarian Tumors","Abstract: CRNDE is an oncogene expressed as a long non-coding RNA. However, our team previously reported that the CRNDE gene also encodes a micropeptide, CRNDEP. The amino acid sequence of CRNDEP has recently been revealed by other researchers, too. This study aimed to investigate genetic alterations within the CRNDEP-coding region of the CRNDE gene, methylation profiling of this gene, and CRNDEP expression analysis. All investigations were performed on clinical material from patients with ovarian tumors of diverse aggressiveness. We found that CRNDEP levels were significantly elevated in highly aggressive tumors compared to benign neoplasms. Consistently, a high level of this micropeptide was a negative, independent, prognostic, and predictive factor in high-grade ovarian cancer (hgOvCa) patients. The cancer-promoting role of CRNDE(P), shown in our recent study, was also supported by genetic and epigenetic results obtained herein, revealing no CRNDEP-disrupting mutations in any clinical sample. Moreover, in borderline ovarian tumors (BOTS), but not in ovarian cancers, the presence of a single nucleotide polymorphism in CRNDE, rs115515594, significantly increased the risk of recurrence. Consistently, in BOTS only, the same genetic variant was highly overrepresented compared to healthy individuals. We also discovered that hypomethylation of CRNDE is associated with increased aggressiveness of ovarian tumors. Accordingly, hypomethylation of this gene’s promoter/first exon correlated with hgOvCa resistance to chemotherapy, but only in specimens with accumulation of the TP53 tumor suppressor protein. Taken together, these results contribute to a better understanding of the role of CRNDE(P) in tumorigenesis and potentially may lead to improvements in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of ovarian neoplasms.",Homo sapiens,GSE262765,2024/07/27,3.0,4.0,3.0,2.0,"This dataset investigates the role of the CRNDE gene in ovarian tumors, which is not directly related to lung cancer.

216,200228527,NFAT signaling is indispensable for persistent memory responses of MCMV-specific CD8+ T cells,"Cytomegalovirus (CMV) induces a uniquely robust and persistent T cell response, where the size of the antigen-specific population does not contract, but rather inflates during viral latency. It has been proposed that intermittent engagements of T cell receptors (TCRs) by viral antigens upon subclinical episodes of virus reactivation feed the inflation of CMV-specific memory cells, but evidence of TCR engagement has remained lacking. Nuclear factor of activated T cells (NFAT) is a family of transcription factors, where NFATc1, NFATc2 and NFATc3 are expressed in mature T lymphocytes, of which NFATc1 and NFATc2 are the dominating family members. In an in vivo model of mouse CMV (MCMV) infection of mice with genetic ablation of NFAT signaling, we show a selective impact of this defect in TCR signaling on the long-term inflation of MCMV-specific CD8 T cell responses, while the initial responses to acute infection remain largely maintained. NFATc1 ablation had an immediate effect, while ablation of both NFATs had the most profound influence. In presence of other lymphocytes, NFAT deficiency in T cells had no effect on virus replication or latency, but in adoptive immunotherapy of RAG2-deficient recipient mice, the lack of both NFAT molecules in solely transplanted CD8+ T cells uncovered their decreased antiviral efficacy. We characterized CD8 responses in absence of either or both NFAT molecules by transcriptome analyses and demonstrate that T cell-intrinsic NFAT is not necessary for CD8 T cell priming, but rather for their maturation towards effector memory and in particular the effector cells, which dominate the pool of inflationary cells.",Mus musculus,GSE228527,2024/01/25,4.7,5.0,4.0,5.0,"This dataset examines CD8+ T cell responses in the context of CMV infection, which is relevant to immune responses but does not specifically address lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Here, we investigate the role of the primary cilia, a highly-specialised sensory organelle, in biliary injury leading to biliary complications. Human biopsies were used to study the structure and function of primary cilia in liver transplant recipients that develop biliary complications (N=7), compared to successful transplants (N=12). To study the biological effects of the primary cilia during transplantation, we used murine models that recapitulate liver procurement and cold storage conditions, and the K19CreERT Kif3a flox/flox mouse model to conditionally eliminate primary cilia in cholangiocytes. Microarray and RNA-seq analysis were used to study these biological effects at the transcriptional level. To explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed phenotypes, we used in vitro models of ischemia, cellular senescence and primary cilia ablation. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to target cellular senescence and the primary cilia, in mouse models and human donor livers. Prolonged ischemic periods pre-transplantation result in ciliary shortening and cellular senescence. Primary cilia damage results in biliary injury and a loss of regenerative potential. Initiation of senescence negatively primary cilia structure, establishing a negative feedback loop that further impairs regeneration.

223,200238231,p53 deficient breast cancer cells reprogram pre-adipocytes towards tumor protective immunomodulatory cells (WEP),"The TP53 gene is mutated in approximately 30% of all breast cancer cases. Adipocytes and preadipocytes, which constitute a substantial fraction of the stroma of normal mammary tissue and of breast tumors, undergo transcriptional, metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming during breast cancer development and play an important role in tumor progression. We report here that p53 loss in breast cancer cells facilitates the reprogramming of preadipocytes, inducing them to acquire a unique transcriptional and metabolic program that combines impaired adipocytic differentiation with augmented cytokine expression. This, in turn, promotes the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including increased abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and elevated expression of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1. We also describe a potential gain-of-function effect of several common p53 missense mutations on the inflammatory reprogramming of preadipocytes. Altogether, our study implicates p53 loss in breast cancer cells as a driver of tumor-supportive adipose tissue reprogramming, expanding the network of non-cell autonomous mechanisms whereby p53 may act as a tumor suppressor. Further elucidation of the interplay between p53 mutations and adipocytes within the tumor microenvironment may suggest novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer patients.",Mus musculus,GSE238231,2024/07/01,4.7,5.0,5.0,4.0,"While this dataset examines the role of p53 in breast cancer and its implications for immunomodulation, it does not directly address lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Despite the great success of PD-1 inhibitors in a fraction of cancer patients, lack of checkpoint molecule expression and persistence of immunosuppressive cells limit the effects of the therapy. To overcome the limitations, combination therapies or direct stimulation of myeloid cells are being investigated. Nonetheless, combination therapies increase the incidence of side effects, and a single agent co-stimulating T cell and myeloid populations might be a better strategy. Exploring single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple human cancers and mouse tumor model, we found pleiotropic expression of interleukin 7 receptor on T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Treatment of recombinant IL7 induced expansion of effector CD8 T cells along with pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and dendritic cells.

Intriguingly, LUAD can histologically transform into SCLC following treatment with targeted therapies. Here we designed models to follow the conversion of LUAD to SCLC and found the barrier to histological transformation converges on tolerance to Myc, which we implicate as a lineage-specific driver of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. Histological transformations are frequently accompanied by activation of the Akt pathway. Manipulating this pathway permitted tolerance to Myc as an oncogenic driver, producing rare, stem-like cells, transcriptionally resembling the pulmonary basal lineage.

228,200271392,Transcriptomic profiling of medulla and cervical spinal cord to study respiratory neuropathology in Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7,"Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is an autosomal dominant neurological disorder caused by a deleterious CAG repeat expansion in the coding region of the ataxin-7 gene. The number of CAG repeats determines the severity and age of onset of the disease. Infantile onset SCA7 leads to severe clinical manifestations including dysphagia, aspiration pneumonia and respiratory distress, but the exact cause of respiratory impairment remains unclear. Using the infantile SCA7 mouse model – the SCA7266Q/5Q mouse, we examined the impact of mutant ataxin-7 on the respiratory control centers. Specifically, we examined the effect of pathological poly-Q-ataxin-7 expression on hypoglossal (XII) and phrenic motor units. Further, we identified the transcript profile of the medulla and cervical spinal cord and, investigated the XII and phrenic nerve structure as well as the neuromuscular junctions in the diaphragm and tongue. SCA-7 astrocytes showed significant intranuclear and cytoplasmic inclusions of ataxin-7 in the XII and putative phrenic motor nuclei. Transcriptomic analysis revealed dysregulation of genes involved in amino acid and neurotransmitter transportation, and myelination. Additionally, SCA7 mice demonstrated blunted efferent output of the XII nerve and demyelination in both XII and phrenic nerves. Finally, there was an increased number of NMJ clusters with higher expression of synaptic markers in SCA7 mice compared to WT controls. Thus, pathological ataxin-7 expression disrupts myelination and neurotransmitter transportation, and impairs glial cell function in the respiratory control centers. These pre-clinical findings elucidate the underlying pathophysiology responsible for dysphagia, aspiration and respiratory failure in infantile SCA7.",Mus musculus,GSE271392,2024/07/04,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This dataset focuses on respiratory neuropathology in a specific neurological disorder and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

231,200269769,8-Oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 hijacked by nucleoprotein conceals guanine oxidation in respiratory syncytial virus RNA,"Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV), alongside other prominent respiratory RNA viruses such as influenza and SARS-CoV-2, significantly contributes to the global incidence of respiratory tract infections. These pathogens prompt the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which play a crucial role in the onset and progression of respiratory diseases. However, the strategies by which viral RNA manages ROS-induced base oxidation are not well understood. Here we uncover that 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine (8-oxoGua) is not merely an incidental byproduct of ROS activity but serves as a strategic adaptation of RSV RNA during replication within host cells. Through RNA immunoprecipitation and next-generation sequencing, we discovered that 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase 1 (OGG1) binding sites are predominantly found in the RSV antigenome, especially within guanine-rich areas. Further investigation revealed that viral ribonucleoprotein complexes specifically hijack OGG1. Crucially, our findings show that inhibiting OGG1's ability to recognize 8-oxoGua leads to a substantial reduction in RSV progeny production. Our results underscore the viral replication machinery's adaptation to oxidative challenges, pointing to the inhibition of OGG1's reading function as a potential novel strategy for antiviral intervention.",Homo sapiens,GSE269769,2024/06/13,,,,,,,

While macrophages are thought to contribute to repair, whether distinct subsets occupy particular niches and assume dedicated tasks to mediate host recovery post- injury remains unknown. Using an in vivo model of influenza A virus (IAV) infection in combination with single-cell and spatial transcriptomic analyses, bone marrow chimeras and monocyte fate-mapping, we found the transitional appearance of Ccr2-dependent monocyte-derived Ly6G+ macrophages (Ly6G Macs) after viral clearance. Ly6G Macs inhabited the alveolar spaces of regenerating perilesional areas, exhibited a unique ultrastructural morphology as well as a high metabolic potential. Using in vivo gene targeting and ex vivo wound healing assays, we found that Ly6G Macs could limit disease severity and promote alveolar regeneration via interleukin-4 receptor- and arginase-1-dependent mechanisms acting on type 2 alveolar epithelial cells. We also found evidence that similar macrophages existed in other models of lung injury and in the airways of virally-infected humans. Our study thus identifies perilesional alveolar Ly6G Macs as a spatially-restricted short-lived macrophage subset engaging a crosstalk with type 2 alveolar epithelial cells to promote alveolar regeneration and recovery post-injury, thus representing an attractive therapeutic target.",Mus musculus,GSE244727,2024/05/30,,,,,,,
234,200242055,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironmentg [scRNA-seq_TAM],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE242055,2024/02/02,,,,,,,

237,200254622,Targeting Fatty Acid Oxidation Enhances Response to HER2-targeted Therapy,"Metabolic reprogramming is a hallmark of tumorigenesis and includes alterations in glucose and fatty acid metabolism. In this study, we investigated the role of Carnitine palmitoyl transferase 1A (CPT1A), a key enzyme in fatty acid oxidation (FAO), in the induction of HER2+ (Human Epidermal growth factor 2, ErbB2) breast cancer. Using an ErbB2+ genetically engineered mouse models, we found that ablation of CPT1A delayed tumor onset and reduced tumor growth, angiogenesis, and metastatic capacity. CPT1A-deficient ErbB2+ cells exhibited impaired mitochondrial function, leading to a reliance on the tricarboxylic acid cycle to reduce NAD+/FAD for energy production. Consequently, loss of CPT1A resulted in glucose dependency and an inability to metabolize fats. CPT1A-deficient ErbB2+ tumor cells exhibited increased oxidative stress and upregulated nuclear factor erythroid 2-related factor 2 (NRF2) activity. Inhibiting NRF2 or silencing its expression reduced proliferation and glucose consumption in CPT1A-deficient cells. In pre-clinical models of ErbB2+ breast cancer, combining a ketogenic diet with an anti-ErbB2 monoclonal antibody in the context of CPT1A deficiency significantly reduced tumor growth and increased survival. Furthermore, combining the ketogenic diet with CPT1A ablation suppressed tumor growth, enhanced apoptosis, and reduced lung metastasis. Additionally, using an immunocompetent model, we provide evidence that CPT1A inhibition attenuated tumor growth and proliferation by promoting an antitumor immune microenvironment that enhanced the efficacy of ErbB2 targeted therapy.

241,200135667,Col6a1-/- Mouse Lung,"Collagen 6 (COL6) is known for its role in a spectrum of congenital muscular dystrophies, which are often accompanied by respiratory dysfunction. However, little is known regarding the function of COL6 in the lung. We confirmed the presence of COL6 throughout the basement membrane region of mouse lung tissue. We studied lung structure and organization in a previously described Col6a1-/- mouse, which do not produce detectable COL6 in the lung. The Col6a1-/- mouse displayed multiple histopathological alveolar and airway abnormalities. The airspaces of Col6a1-/- lungs appeared simplified, with larger (29%, p<0.01) and fewer (31%, p<0.001) alveoli. These airspace abnormalities included a reduction in IsolectinB4+ alveolar capillaries and Sftpc+ ATII cells. Alterations in lung function consistent with these histopathological changes were evident. Col6a1-/- mice also displayed multiple airway changes including increased branching (59%, p<0.001), increased mucosal thickness (34%, p<0.001) and increased epithelial cell density (13%, p<0.001). Comprehensive transcriptome analysis revealed loss of COL6 is associated with reductions in integrin-paxillin-PI3K signaling in vivo. In vitro, COL6 promoted steady-state phospho-paxillin levels and reduced cell density (16-28%, p<0.05) at confluence.

243,200272168,Life long effects of radiation and high fat dieat on the mouse left ventricular tissue,"We studied the long-term effects of single whole-body gamma and simulated GCR irradiation (IR) and consumption of a Western Diet (WD) on the heart's left ventricle (LV). Three-month-old C57Bl/6J wild-type male and female mice were assigned to the following groups: 1) Gamma-irradiated with follow-up at 440(males and females) and 660(males)/550(females) days post-IR; 2) simGCRsim-irradiated with follow-up at 440(males and females) and 660(males)/550(females) days post-IR; 3) 270-days WD-fed animals with followup at 530 (males and females) and 750(males)/640(females). Control groups consisted of non-irradiated (non-IR) mice and normal diet-fed mice. Control groups were followed up similarly to the treatment groups. LV tissues were collected at follow-up and subjected to bulk RNA sequencing analysis. Total RNA was extracted from LV tissues using the RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, USA) according to the manufacturer’s protocol and stored at -80°C until further use.

245,200237615,53BP1 loss elicits cGAS-STING-dependent antitumor immunity in ovarian and pancreatic cancer,"53BP1 nucleates the anti-end resection machinery at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby countering BRCA1 activity. Loss of 53BP1 leads to DNA end processing and homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA1-deficient cells. Consequently, BRCA1-mutant tumors, typically sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), become resistant in the absence of 53BP1. Here, we demonstrate that the 'leaky' DNA end resection in the absence of 53BP1 results in increased micronuclei and cytoplasmic dsDNA, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and pro-inflammatory signaling. This enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration, activates macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, and impedes tumor growth. Loss of 53BP1 correlates with a response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and improved overall survival. Immunohistochemical assessment of 53BP1 in two malignancies, high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)s and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)s, which are refractory to ICBs, revealed that lower 53BP1 levels correlated with an increased adaptive and innate immune response. Finally, BRCA1-deficient tumors that develop resistance to PARPi due to the loss of 53BP1 are susceptible to ICB. Therefore, we conclude that 53BP1 is critical for tumor immunogenicity and underpins the response to ICB. Our results support including 53BP1 expression as an exploratory biomarker in ICB trials for malignancies typically refractory to immunotherapy.",Mus musculus,GSE237615,2024/07/09,3.7,4.0,4.0,3.0,"This dataset discusses the role of 53BP1 in ovarian and pancreatic cancer, with implications for immune checkpoint blockade.

246,200260575,Bojungikki-Tang Enhances the Efficacy of Pembrolizumab Treatment in Human PBMC-Injected H460 Tumor-Bearing Mice,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have become a major treatment option for non-small cell lung cancer, but their efficacy is still limited because only a subset of patients responded to ICIs. Bojungikki-Tang (BJIKT), a widely used herbal medicine extracted from 10 medicinal plants, has been largely investigated as a combined treatment with anticancer agents. In this study, we examined the potential anti-tumor effect of co-administration of BJIKT and pembrolizumab in human peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC)-injected H460 tumor-bearing MHC Ⅰ/Ⅱ double knockout NSG mice. We found that combination treatment with BJIKT and pembrolizumab significantly suppressed tumor growth by regulating the activation of immune cells. Immunohistochemistry analysis showed that the combination therapy decreased the exhausted proportion of CD8(+) and CD4(+) T cells expressing PD-1 and LAG-3 markers in the tumor tissues. Our transcriptome analysis indicated that BJIKT strengthened T cell function and TNF signaling and inhibited TGF-β signaling to induce cell cycle arrest and apoptosis. Additionally, BJIKT synergistically exhibited anti-tumor effects along with immune-related pathways when combined with pembrolizumab.

249,200248746,Olfactory neuroblastoma mimics molecular subtypes and lineage trajectories of small cell lung cancer [Single nucleus RNA-seq on human ONB tumor],"The olfactory epithelium relies on active neuron regeneration from basal stem cells and is susceptible to olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB), a rare, aggressive tumor of unclear origins. Here, we establish a new, highly-penetrant, genetically-engineered mouse model of ONB with alterations in Rb1/Trp53/Myc that exhibit a NEUROD1+ immature neuronal state. ASCL1 loss leads to emergence of non-neuronal histopathologies, including a POU2F3+ microvillar-like state. We find ONB tumor heterogeneity to recapitulate developmental states of multipotent globose basal cells (GBCs), which our data demonstrate is a cell of origin for ONB. Similar to small cell lung cancer (SCLC), mouse and human ONB exhibit: mutually exclusive ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3- like states, an immune-cold tumor microenvironment, intratumoral subtype heterogeneity comprising neuronal and non-neuronal lineages, and subtype plasticity—as evidenced by barcode-based lineage tracing and single-cell transcriptomics.

250,200246741,MBNL1 regulates programmed postnatal switching between regenerative and differentiated cardiac states [RNA-seq],"Background: Discovering determinants of cardiomyocyte maturity will be critical to understanding the maintenance of differentiated states and potentially reawakening endogenous regenerative programs in adult mammalian hearts as a therapeutic strategy. Recent evidence has suggested that forced dedifferentiation paired with oncogene expression is sufficient to drive cardiac regeneration. However, elucidation of endogenous developmental determinants of the switch between regenerative and mature cardiomyocyte cell states is necessary for optimal design of regenerative approaches for heart disease. Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) regulates both fibroblast and erythroid differentiation and proliferation. Hence, we examined whether MBNL1 promotes and maintains mature cardiomyocyte states while antagonizing cardiomyocyte proliferation. Methods: MBNL1 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models were studied at several developmental timepoints and in surgical models of heart regeneration. Multi-omics approaches were combined with biochemical, histological, and in vitro genetic work to determine the mechanisms through which MBNL1 exerts its effects. Results: MBNL1 is co-expressed with a maturation-association genetic program in the heart and is regulated by the MEIS1/Calcineurin signaling axis. Targeted MBNL1 overexpression early in development prematurely transitioned cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic growth, hypoplasia, and dysfunction, while loss of MBNL1 function increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and proliferation through altered cell cycle inhibitor transcript stability. Moreover, MBNL1-dependent stabilization of estrogen-related receptor signaling was essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte maturity in adult myocytes. In accordance with these data, modulating MBNL1 dose tuned the temporal window of neonatal cardiac regeneration, where increased MBNL1 expression arrested myocyte proliferation and regeneration, and MBNL1 deletion promoted regenerative states with prolonged myocyte proliferation. However, MBNL1 deletion was not sufficient to promote regeneration in the adult heart due to cell-cycle checkpoint activation. Conclusions: Here, MBNL1 was identified as an essential regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiated states, their developmental switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth, and their regenerative potential through controlling an entire maturation program by stabilizing adult myocyte mRNAs during postnatal development and throughout adulthood. Additionally, MBNL1-dependent perturbations of a myocyte’s preferred growth mechanism at a given developmental state had detrimental consequences to cardiac function, and targeting loss of maturity and removing cell cycle inhibitors was not insufficient to promote adult regeneration.",Mus musculus,GSE246741,2024/03/07,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on cardiac states and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy, making it minimally relevant.",This dataset focuses on cardiac states and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

251,200246398,BIOLOGICAL EFFECTS OF CORTICOSTEROIDS ON PNEUMOCOCCAL PNEUMONIA IN MICE AND HUMANS,"Rationale: Streptococcus pneumoniae is the most common bacterial cause of community acquired pneumonia. Some clinical trials have demonstrated a beneficial effect of corticosteroid therapy in community acquired pneumonia, but the mechanisms of this benefit remain unclear. Objectives: To investigate the biologic effects of corticosteroids in pneumococcal pneumonia in mice and in patients Methods: We studied lower respiratory tract transcriptomes from an observational cohort of mechanically ventilated patients and from a pneumonia model in mice. We also carried out comprehensive physiologic, biochemical, and histological analyses in mice to identify mechanisms of lung injury in S. pneumoniae with and without adjunctive steroid therapy. Measurement and Main Results: Transcriptomic analysis identified pleiotropic effects of steroid therapy on the lower respiratory tract in critically ill patients with pneumococcal pneumonia, findings that were reproducible in mice. In mice with pneumonia, dexamethasone in combination with ceftriaxone reduced (1) pulmonary edema formation, (2) alveolar protein permeability, (3) proinflammatory cytokine release, (4) histopathology lung injury score, and (5) hypoxemia, but did not increase bacterial burden. Conclusions: In combination with appropriate antibiotics in mice, treatment of pneumococcal pneumonia with steroid therapy reduces hypoxemia, pulmonary edema, lung permeability, and histologic criteria of lung injury, and also altered inflammatory responses at the protein and gene expression level.

252,200198517,Inhibition of SWI/SNF broadly disrupts enhancers and reveals remodeler redundancy at promoters,"Appropriate gene expression requires the establishment of accessible chromatin at promoters and enhancers. These patterns are maintained thorugh the action of, such as the SWI/SNF family. Despite this critical role, previous studies have remained inconclusive regarding the direct role of SWI/SNF. Herein, we employ BRM014, a fast-acting small-molecule inhibitor of the SWI/SNF ATPase subunit, to probe the direct response of mouse embryonic stem cells to disruption of appropriate SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling activity. We demonstrate that the immediate role of SWI/SNF inhibition is a broad loss of chromatin accessibility at both promoter and enhancer loci, and this is reflected in an associated reduction in nascent transcription. We determine that this initial perturbation can be compensated for at a majority of gene promoters, such that these elements regain accessibilty and gene expression under prolonged treatment. However, a subset of gene promoters, as well as most enhancers, fail to recover under these conditions. Finally, we identify EP400 as a putative factor driving compensation ability, as the loss of this factor impedes promoter recovery.",Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,GSE198517,2023/11/02,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates chromatin remodeling and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, which is not related to lung cancer or immunotherapy, making it minimally relevant.","This dataset investigates chromatin remodeling and gene expression in mouse embryonic stem cells, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in minimal relevance.","This dataset focuses on chromatin remodeling in embryonic stem cells, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

253,200252588,Intersectional genetic tracing reveals the origin of alveolar stem cells during lung repair and regeneration,"Alveolar type 2 (AT2) cells are stem cells of the alveolar epithelia. Previous genetic lineage tracing studies reported multiple cellular origins for AT2 cells after injury. However, conventional lineage tracing based on Cre-loxP has the limitation of non-specific labeling. Thus, the exact contribution of various epithelial cells to the pools of AT2 cells under different conditions remains unclear. Here, we used dual recombinases-mediated intersectional genetic lineage tracing to investigate the cellular origins of AT2 cells during lung homeostasis, injury and repair. In contrast to previous studies, we found AT1 cells were terminally differentiated cells and did not contribute to AT2 cells after lung injury and repair. Distinctive, but simultaneous, labeling of club cells, bronchioalveolar stem cells (BASCs), and AT2 cells revealed the exact contribution of each to AT2 cells after lung injury. Moreover, we found that club cells have the potential to rebuild virtually all alveoli in some severely injured lung regions. Mechanistically, Notch signaling promotes a BASCs-to-AT2 cell transition, but it inhibits club cell-to-AT2 cell conversion during lung repair. This intersectional genetic lineage tracing strategy with enhanced precision allowed us to elucidate the physiological role of AT1, club, BASCs, and AT2 cells to alveolar regeneration after injury.",Mus musculus,GSE252588,2024/01/06,4.3,3.0,5.0,5.0,"This dataset studies alveolar stem cells in lung repair and regeneration, which is somewhat relevant to lung cancer.

YB2 and YB3 function redundantly and positively regulate plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea ， which are specially required for transcriptional activation of a set of JA-responsive genes following inoculation. Furthermore, YB2 and YB3 modulated their expression through direct occupancy and interaction with histone demethylase Ref6 to remove repressive histone modifications. Moreover, YB2 and YB3 physically interacted with JAZ repressorsand negatively modulated their abundance, which in turn attenuated the inhibition of JAZ proteins on the transcription of JA- responsive genes, thereby activating JA response and promoting disease resistance. Overall, our study reveals the positive regulator of YB2 and YB3 in JA signaling by positively regulating transcription of JA-responsive genes and negatively modulating the abundance of JAZ proteins.",Arabidopsis thaliana,GSE247053,2024/07/15,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on plant biology and jasmonate signaling, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy, making it minimally relevant.","This dataset focuses on plant biology and jasmonate signaling, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in minimal relevance.","This dataset focuses on plant biology and jasmonate signaling, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

258,200253633,Immune profiling-based targeting of pathogenic T cells with ustekinumab in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis is a life-threatening autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis (ANCA-GN). To date, treatment of most patients with ANCA-GN relies on unspecific immunosuppressive agents that harbor serious adverse effects and limited efficiency. By performing spatial and single-cell transcriptome analysis, we characterized inflammatory niches in the kidneys of 34 patients with ANCA-GN and identified pro-inflammatory, cytokine producing CD4+ (TH1 and TH17 subsets) and CD8+ T cells (TC1 and TC17-like subsets) as a key pathogenic signature. Digital pharmacology identified ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23 in these T cells, as the most promising therapeutic drug to target. Based on these findings, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN were treated with ustekinumab in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide. Ustekinumab was given subcutaneously (90 mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24 and clinical and renal responses were evaluated at week 26. This treatment was well-tolerated and induced clinical response in all ANCA-GN patients, including an improved kidney function and Birmingham Vasculitis Activity Score. Our findings suggest that the pathogenesis-based treatment of ANCA-GN patients with ustekinumab is efficacious and warrants further investigation in clinical trials.",Homo sapiens,GSE253633,2024/07/01,2.3,2.0,1.0,4.0,"This dataset investigates immune profiling in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

260,200248986,The immunosuppressive Tuberculosis-associated microenvironment inhibits viral replication and promotes HIV-1 latency in CD4+ T cells,"Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb), the causative agent of tuberculosis (TB), is the most common coinfection among people living with HIV-1. This coinfection alters the efficacy of the immune response against both HIV-1 and Mtb, and is associated with accelerated HIV-1 disease progression and reduced survival. Enhanced HIV-1 replication in macrophages induced by Mtb coinfection may contribute to the worsened clinical outcomes observed in HIV-1/TB coinfected individuals. However, the impact of the HIV-1/TB coinfection on HIV-1 replication and latency in CD4+ T cells remains poorly studied. In this study, we used the acellular fraction of tuberculous pleural effusion (TB-PE) as a proxy for the microenvironment generated by Mtb infection. Using this physiologically relevant fluid, we investigated whether viral replication and HIV-1 latency in CD4+ T cells are affected by a TB-associated microenvironment. Interestingly, our results revealed that TB-PE shaped the transcriptional profile of CD4+ T cells impairing T cell receptor-dependent cell activation and decreased HIV-1 replication. Moreover, this immunosuppressive TB microenvironment promoted viral latency and inhibited HIV-1 reactivation in CD4+ T cells from people living with HIV-1. This study indicates that the immune response induced by TB may contribute to the persistence of the viral reservoir by silencing HIV-1 expression in individuals coinfected with both pathogens, allowing the virus to persist undetected by the immune system and increasing the size of the HIV-1 latent reservoir in cells at the site of the coinfection.",Homo sapiens,GSE248986,2024/07/01,1.7,1.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset focuses on the immunosuppressive effects of tuberculosis on HIV-1 latency in CD4+ T cells.

261,200271247,Sequential redox vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential during the acquisition of drug resistance in BRAFV600E lung adenocarcinoma,"The current targeted therapy for lung cancer patients harbouring BRAFV600E alterations consists of a dual blockade of RAF and MEK kinases often combining dabrafenib with trametinib (D/T). This regimen results in extended survival when compared to single agent treatments but, as with other targeted therapies, disease progression is unavoidable. There is limited information of how BRAFV600E-driven lung adenocarcinomas adapt to this targeted treatment and persist before clinical relapse is detected. At this point, a significant fraction of these resistant tumours display mutations in other members of the RAS-ERK pathway and counteract the inhibitors effect by reactivating oncogenic signalling. We demonstrate here that oxidative stress together with the concomitant induction of antioxidant responses is a prominent and early feature boosted by D/T treatment. However, the nature of the oxidative damage and the choice of redox detoxification systems elicited by cancer cells display substantial differences during the process leading to the onset of drug resistance. While persister cells suffer from lipid peroxidation and strongly rely on GPX4 to prevent ferroptosis-driven cell death, D/T resistant tumours harbouring NRAS secondary mutations enhance cystine transport to boost antioxidant responses. Accordingly, timely inhibition of these detox programs by GPX4 or HDAC inhibitors decrease resistant cell viability and extend therapeutic efficacy.",Homo sapiens,GSE271247,2024/07/02,9.0,9.0,9.0,9.0,"This dataset investigates the mechanisms of drug resistance in BRAFV600E lung adenocarcinoma, which is directly related to lung cancer.

They also contribute to the different phases of mammary gland remodeling during development, pregnancy and involution post-lactation. Yet, less is known about the dynamics of mammary gland macrophages in the lactation stage. Here, we describe a macrophage population present during lactation in mice. By multi-parameter flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing we reveal this population as distinct from the two resident macrophage subsets present pregestationally. These lactation-induced macrophages (LiMacs) are predominantly monocyte-derived and expand by proliferation in situ concomitant with nursing. LiMacs develop independently of IL-34 but require CSF-1 signaling and are partly microbiota-dependent. Locally, they reside adjacent to the basal cells of the alveoli and extravasate into the milk.

However, the activation program and source of injury-induced facultative progenitors remain incompletely known. Here, we find that lung injury induces emergence of p63-expressing progenitors, which rapidly proliferate and differentiate into alveolar type-1 (AT1) and type-2 (AT2) cells. scRNA-seq analysis uncovers that a subset of p63+ progenitors exhibit two distinct parallele transient stages before differentiation into mature AT1 and AT2 cells, respectively. Dual recombinases-mediated sequential genetic tracing reveals that facultative p63+ progenitors originate from the distal airway secretory cells and subsequently regenerate alveoli.

265,200242154,Spatial immuno-oncology protein abundance profiles in hepatocellular carcinoma tissues from patients treated with bavituximab and pembrolizumab,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) targeting PD-1/L1 have modest efficacy in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as single agents, but combination regimens have demonstrated increased clinical benefit at the expense of treatment toxicities. Exposed phosphatidylserine suppresses the innate immune response in the tumor microenvironment (TME). Targeting phosphatidylserine does not induce tumor responses in the clinical setting when used as monotherapy or in combination with cytotoxic and targeted therapies, but may induce pro-inflammatory and –immune stimulating effects that enhance ICI activity. This hypothesis was tested in a single-arm phase 2 trial evaluating bavituximab, a phosphatidylserine targeting antibody, plus pembrolizumab in patients with unresectable HCC who had not received prior systemic treatments (ClinicalTrials.gov ID: NCT03519997). The primary end point was investigator-assessed objective response rate (ORR) among evaluable patients, and secondary end points included progression-free survival (PFS) and the incidence of adverse events. Among 28 evaluable patients, the ORR was 32.1%, including 2 complete responses, and a disease control rate of 64.3%. Median PFS was 6.3 months (95% CI, 1.3-11.3 months). Treatment related adverse events of any grade occurred in 45.7% of patients with grade 3 or 4 adverse events occurring in 14.3% of patients. Exploratory analyses of baseline tumor specimens showed that a depletion of B cells, and the expression of smooth muscle actin and immune checkpoints in stroma was associated with tumor response. An RNA-based TME assay which distinguishes immune-rich of inflammatory tumors was also shown to be predictive of ORR.

268,200240047,A Metabolic Switch Controlling Liver Cancer Evolution from Senescent NASH Hepatocytes,"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), the third most common cancer, originates from differentiated hepatocytes undergoing compensatory proliferation in livers damaged primarily by viruses or nonalcoholic steatohepatitis (NASH)1,2. While increasing HCC risk3, NASH also induces TP53-dependent hepatocyte senescence4. How this tumor-suppressive response is activated but eventually bypassed to license HCC progression is unknown. We identified the gluconeogenic enzyme fructose-1,6-bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1) as a TP53 target, induced in senescent NASH hepatocytes but downregulated in most human HCCs. Initial FBP1 downregulation in disease-associated hepatocytes, whose accumulation precedes HCC development5, activates AKT to inhibits GSK3 substrate binding, thereby augmenting activation of NRF2 which accelerates FBP1 and TP53 degradation. Intrinsic NRF2 activation and FBP1 loss trigger overlapping transcriptomic responses that suppress senescence, enhance hepatocyte proliferation and metabolism, and enable NRAS- or NASH-induced hepatocarcinogenesis. This AKT-dependent metabolic switch, operative in mice and humans, controls NASH to HCC progression. Our results further suggest that NASH-related hepatocyte senescence is triggered by hypernutrition-induced single strand DNA breaks. Senescence reversal enables HCC progenitor expansion and somatic mutagenesis.",Mus musculus,GSE240047,2024/07/15,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset focuses on liver cancer and the metabolic pathways involved, which does not directly relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Polarized monocytes are partially defined by their transcriptional profiles that are influenced by environmental stimuli. The airway monocyte response in pediatric acute respiratory distress syndrome (PARDS) is undefined. Objectives: To identify differentially expressed genes and networks using a novel transcriptomic reporter assay with donor monocytes exposed to the airway fluid of intubated children with and at-risk for PARDS. To determine differences in gene expression at two time points using the donor monocyte assay exposed to airway fluid from intubated children with PARDS obtained 48-96 hours following initial tracheal aspirate sampling. Design, Setting and Participants: In vitro pilot study carried out using airway fluid supernatant from 57 children: 44 children with PARDS and 13 children at-risk for PARDS. Main Outcomes and Measures: We performed bulk RNA sequencing using a transcriptomic reporter assay of monocytes exposed to airway fluid from intubated children to discover gene networks differentiating PARDS from at-risk for PARDS.

273,200256331,Comparative gene expression profiling analysis of RNA-seq data for WT (Nipponbare) and OsEXPA7 overexpression.,"Yield and quality are the two most important traits in crop breeding. Exploring the regulatory mechanisms that affect both yield and quality traits is of great significance for understanding the molecular genetic networks controlling these key crop attributes. Expansins are cell wall loosening proteins that play important roles in regulating rice grain size. We investigated the effect of OsEXPA7, encoding an expansin, on rice grain size and quality. OsEXPA7 overexpression resulted in increased plant height, panicle length, grain length, and thousand-grain weight in rice. OsEXPA7 overexpression also affected gel consistency and amylose content in rice grains, thus affecting rice quality. Subcellular localization and tissue expression analyses showed that OsEXPA7 is localized on the cell wall and is highly expressed in the panicle. Hormone treatment experiments revealed that OsEXPA7 expression mainly responds to methyl jasmonate, brassinolide, and gibberellin. Transcriptome analysis and RT-qPCR experiments showed that overexpression of OsEXPA7 affects the expression of OsJAZs in the jasmonic acid pathway and BZR1 and GE in the brassinosteroid pathway. In addition, OsEXPA7 regulates the expression of key quantitative trait loci related to yield traits, as well as regulates the expression levels of BIP1 and bZIP50 involved in the seed storage protein biosynthesis pathway. These results reveal that OsEXPA7 positively regulates rice yield traits and negatively regulates grain quality traits by involving plant hormone pathways and other trait-related pathway genes.

274,200262447,Selective refueling of CAR T cells using ADA1 and CD26 boosts antitumor immunity,"CAR T cell therapy has revolutionized the treatment of hematologic malignancies, but its efficacy in solid tumors remains limited due to the immunosuppressive nature of the tumor microenvironment and the inability of T cells to persist and traffic to the tumor site. While current strategies focus on enhancing CAR T cell activity through costimulatory molecules and cytokines, a critical yet often overlooked factor is the competition for nutrients between tumor cells and T cells in the nutrient-deprived tumor microenvironment. To address this challenge, we employed a selective metabolic refueling (MR) strategy by providing T cells with inosine as an alternative fuel source for growth and functionality. In this study, we engineered CAR T cells to co-express a membrane-bound CD26 and a cytoplasmic adenosine deaminase 1 (ADA1) fused to an anti-CD3 scFv. ADA1 irreversibly converts both intracellular and extracellular adenosine to inosine, overcoming adenosine-mediated immunosuppression and providing T cells with inosine for growth. The inclusion of an anti-CD3 scFv fusion partner and overexpressing CD26 boosts ADA1 capture in a membrane proximal manner, providing inosine for T cells and minimizing feeding the tumor cells. We demonstrate that ADA1 is conditionally secreted in an autocrine manner in response to CD3/CD26 stimulation and that it activates CAR T cells through trans-signaling in a tumor-specific manner. In addition, we show that, compared to unmodified CAR T cells, CD26-overexpressing CAR T cells have better migration capacity and are less susceptible to TGF-β1 suppression. Finally, we demonstrate that, in mice models of human hepatocellular carcinoma (GPC3-MR-CAR) and human non-small cell lung cancer (HER2-MR-CAR), metabolically refueled CAR T cells (MR-CAR) are more efficient in reducing tumor growth than unmodified CAR T cells.

276,200261894,A screening study identified decitabine as an inhibitor of Equid Herpesvirus 4 that enhances the innate antiviral response,"Equid herpesvirus 4 (EHV-4) is a frequent respiratory pathogen of the horse. EHV-4 sporadically induces abortion or neonatal death and although not clearly demonstrated its involvement in neurological forms is strongly suspected. Despite preventive treatments using vaccines against EHV-1/EHV-4, the resurgence of α-EHV infection still constitutes an important threat to the horse industry. Yet very few studies have been conducted on the search for antiviral molecules against EHV-4. A screening of 42 antiviral compounds was performed in vitro on E. Derm cells infected with EHV-4 405/76 reference strain (VR2230). Formation of cytopathic effects was monitored by Real-Time Cell Analysis (RTCA) and the viral load was quantified by qPCR.

280,200250138,Immune profiling-based targeting of pathogenic T cells with ustekinumab in ANCA-associated glomerulonephritis,"Antineutrophil cytoplasmic antibody (ANCA)–associated vasculitis is a life-threatening autoimmune disease that often results in kidney failure caused by crescentic glomerulonephritis (ANCA-GN). To date, treatment of most patients with ANCA-GN relies on unspecific immunosuppressive agents that harbor serious adverse effects and limited efficiency. Using spatial and single-cell transcriptome analysis we characterized inflammatory niches in the kidneys of 34 patients with ANCA-GN and idenjpgied proinflammatory cytokine producing CD4+ and CD8+ T cells as a key pathogenic tissue signature. By employing digital pharmacology we then idenjpgied ustekinumab, a monoclonal antibody targeting IL-12 and IL-23 in these T cells, as promising therapeutic avenue. Based on these findings, four patients with relapsing ANCA-GN were treated with ustekinumab in combination with low-dose cyclophosphamide. Ustekinumab was given subcutaneously (90 mg) at weeks 0, 4, 12, and 24 and clinical and renal response were evaluated at week 26.

281,200253318,Transcriptional profiling and multiple machine learning methods identified novel microglia biomarkers for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis,"Background: Microglia plays complex and crucial roles in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study aimed to explore the biological significance of microglia-associated genes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) . Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened with six machine learning (ML) methods, which were also utilized to validate the microglia-associated DEGs in three public databases. ceRNA and Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were utilized to identify the interaction of the 6 novel biomarkers with other molecules. Then, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were employed to quantify the relative abundance of each immune cell infiltration, respectively. qRT-PCR was performed to test the expression of key DEGs in murine models. Results: A total of 247 DEmRNA, 499 DElncRNAs and 269 DEcircRNAs were identified. With screening strategy of five ML algorithms, 6 DEmRNAs were obtained including NGP, HIST1H2BJ, PBLD1, MBLN3, CD180 and F10. Then the 6 DEmRNAs were used as a multigene signature to construct models to differentiate EAE from normal microglia, and AUC value for each model was greater than 0.8. The diagnostic value of these 6 DEmRNAs were identified and further verified by qRT-PCR. Then, differential expression for five out of these 6 DEmRNAs, namely NGP, HIST1H2BJ, PBLD1, MBLN3, and F10 were confirmed. Using PPI analysis, DEmRNAs frequently interacting with transcription factors (TFs), potential drugs and RBPs were identified. With immune cell infiltration analyses, we found EAE microglia presented high levels of immune infiltration, especially Nature Killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells. We also reported circRNA (circRNA_00638) was predicted to bind to 76 RBPs. Conclusions: We identified and validated 6 novel microglia related genes and developed a multigene signature with ML methods to confirm their ability to accurately diagnose and characterize biological alterations in EAE microglia.

To understand the functional genomic roles of DNA modifications, it is critical to accurately map their diverse chemical forms with single-nucleotide precision in complex genomes, which however remains challenging. Click-code-seq is the click-chemistry-aided single-nucleotide-resolution method introduced to map oxidation in yeast DNA. Here, we upgraded click-code-seq to enable its first application for sequencing DNA oxidation and depurination in the human genome. For this, we developed a companion fluorescence tagging assay, click-fluoro-quant, to rapidly quantify common modifications. Moreover, we devised novel adapters to minimize false modification detection and assess modification frequency in cell populations. We uncovered that endogenous DNA oxidation in a human cell line has a highly similar pattern to the cancer mutational signatures associated with the effects of reactive oxygen species. We established that the chemotherapy drug irofulven preferentially depurinates ApA dimers and promoter regions. Intriguingly, we revealed that oxidized guanines and apurinic sites, both irofulven-induced and endogenous, are depleted in the transcribed strand of genes, and the strand bias widens with increasing gene expressions.

283,200243202,Title: An IL-23-STAT4 Axis Regulates Classical Dendritic Cell Expansion and Function in Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis,"The signal transducer and activator of transcription 4 (STAT4) promotes protective immunity and autoimmunity downstream of pro-inflammatory cytokines including IL-12 and IL-23. In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), Stat4-/- mice are resistant to the development of inflammation and paralysis. Here, we examined cell-type requirements and found that in addition to T cells, STAT4 is required in dendritic cells for development of EAE. Deficiency of STAT4 in CD11c-expressing cells resulted in decreased T cell priming and inflammation in the CNS. EAE susceptibility was recovered following adoptive transfer of wild type bone marrow-derived DC to mice with STAT4-deficient DCs, but not adoptive transfer of STAT4- or IL-23R-deficient DCs.

285,200268741,A vagal-brainstem interoceptive circuit for cough-like defensive behaviors in mice,"Respiratory defensive behaviors, like coughing, play a crucial role in protecting the respiratory system, ensuring its integrity and optimal function. How these critical behaviors are regulated by sensory stimuli within the body remains largely unknown. Here, we show that the nucleus of the solitary tract (NTS) in mice, a key hub in the brain for processing internal sensory signals and mediating interoceptive processes, contains heterogenous neuronal populations that differentially control breathing. Within these subtypes, activation of tachykinin 1 (Tac1) neurons triggers a specific respiratory behavior. Our detailed characterization of respiratory defensive behaviors reveals that these responses are cough-like behaviors. Chemogenetic silencing or genetic ablation of Tac1 neurons significantly reduces cough-like behaviors induced by tussive challenges. These Tac1 neurons receive synaptic inputs from the bronchopulmonary chemosensory and mechanosensory neurons in the vagal ganglion, and directly integrate the medullary regions to control sequential phases of cough-like defensive behaviors. We propose that these Tac1 neurons are a key component of the airway-vagal-brain neural circuit that controls cough-like defensive behaviors in mice, and they coordinate the downstream modular circuits to elicit the sequential motor pattern of forceful expiratory responses.",Mus musculus,GSE268741,2024/06/05,1.3,1.0,1.0,2.0,This dataset focuses on cough-like defensive behaviors in mice and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

287,200164013,A single-cell and spatial atlas of autopsy tissues reveals pathology and cellular targets of SARS-CoV-2 [gene expression levels],"The SARS-CoV-2 pandemic has caused over 1 million deaths globally, mostly due to acute lung injury and acute respiratory distress syndrome, or direct complications resulting in multiple-organ failures. Little is known about the host tissue immune and cellular responses associated with COVID-19 infection, symptoms, and lethality. To address this, we collected tissues from 11 organs during the clinical autopsy of 17 individuals who succumbed to COVID-19, resulting in a tissue bank of approximately 420 specimens. We generated comprehensive cellular maps capturing COVID-19 biology related to patients’ demise through single-cell and single-nucleus RNA-Seq of lung, kidney, liver and heart tissues, and further contextualized our findings through spatial RNA profiling of distinct lung regions. We developed a computational framework that incorporates removal of ambient RNA and automated cell type annotation to facilitate comparison with other healthy and diseased tissue atlases. In the lung, we uncovered significantly altered transcriptional programs within the epithelial, immune and stromal compartments and cell intrinsic changes in multiple cell types relative to lung tissue from healthy controls. We observed evidence of alveolar type 2 (AT2) differentiation replacing depleted alveolar type 1 (AT1) lung epithelial cells, as previously seen in fibrosis, and a concomitant increase in myofibroblasts reflective of defective tissue repair. Viral reads were enriched in lung mononuclear phagocytic cells and endothelial cells, and these cells expressed distinct viral RNA host response transcriptional programs. We corroborated the compositional and transcriptional changes in lung tissue through spatial analysis of RNA profiles in situ and distinguished unique tissue host responses between regions with and without viral RNA, and in COVID-19 donor tissues relative to healthy lung. Finally, we analyzed genetic regions implicated in COVID-19 GWAS with transcriptomic data to implicate specific cell types and genes associated with disease severity.

288,200233095,STAT3 inhibition permits epigenetic reprogramming and TLR9/IRF8-driven differentiation of inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia [RNASEQ_AML_CPGDOX],"Cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells but achieving leukemic cell immunogenicity proved challenging in clinical setting. Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects.

Here, we showed that type V adenovirus (ADV) induces the polarization of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) to the M2 phenotype and increases the infiltration of regulatory T cells (Tregs) in the tumor microenvironment (TME). By selectively compensating for these deficiencies, Tα1 reprogrammed “M2-like” TAMs toward an antitumoral phenotype, thereby reprogramming the TME into a state more beneficial for antitumor immunity. Moreover, ADVTα1 was constructed by harnessing the merits of all the components for the aforementioned combinatorial therapy. Both in vitro and in vivo data showed that both exogenously supplied and adenovirus-produced Tα1 orchestrate TAM reprogramming and enhance the antitumor efficacy of ADV via CD8+ T cells, showing promising prospects for clinical translation.

290,200137363,PERICYTE-LIKE CELLS UNDERGO TRANSCRIPTIONAL REPROGRAMMING AND DISTINCT FUNCTIONAL ADAPTATIONS IN ACUTE LUNG INJURY,"Background: We previously reported on the role of pericyte-like cells as functional sentinel immune cells in lung injury. However, much about the biology of pericytes in lung injury remains unknown. Lung pericyte-like cells are well-positioned to sense disruption to the epithelial barrier and coordinate local inflammatory responses due to their anatomic niche within the alveoli. In this report, we characterized transcriptional responses and functional changes in pericyte-like cells following activation by alveolar components from injured and uninjured lungs. Methods: We purified pericyte-like cells from lung digests using PDGFR_ as a selection marker and expanded them in culture as previously described (1). We induced sterile acute lung injury in mice with recombinant human Fas ligand (rhFasL) instillation followed by mechanical ventilation (1). We then collected bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) from injured and uninjured mice. Purified pericyte-like cells in culture were exposed to growth media only (control), BALF from uninjured mice, and BALF from injured mice for 6 and 24 h. RNA collected from pericyte-like cells for each of these treatment conditions underwent genome-wide sequencing using RNA-seq. Targets of interest identified by bioinformatics analysis of RNA-seq data were validated using in vitro and in vivo assays. Results: We observed robust global transcriptional changes in pericyte-like cells following treatment with uninjured and injured BALF at 6 h, but this response persisted for 24 h only after exposure to injured BALF. Functional enrichment analysis of pericytes treated with injured BALF revealed activation of immuno-inflammatory, cell migration and angiogenesis-related pathways, whereas processes associated with tissue development and remodeling were down-regulated. We validated select targets in the inflammatory, angiogenesis-related, and cell migratory pathways using functional assays in vitro and in vivo. Conclusion: Lung pericyte-like cells are highly responsive to alveolar compartment content from both uninjured and injured lungs, but injured BALF elicits a more sustained response. The inflammatory, angiogenic, and migratory changes exhibited by activated pericyte-like cells underscore the phenotypic plasticity of these specialized stromal cells in the setting of acute lung injury.",Mus musculus,GSE137363,2020/10/31,4.3,4.0,5.0,4.0,"This dataset investigates pericyte-like cells in acute lung injury, which may have implications for lung cancer treatment.

291,200270875,Targeting Immune-Fibroblast Crosstalk in Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Fibrosis IV,"Inflammation and tissue fibrosis co-exist and are causally linked to organ dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms driving immune-fibroblast crosstalk in human cardiac disease remains unexplored, and there are currently no approved treatments that directly target cardiac fibrosis. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping, and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 donors, acutely infarcted, and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory marked by cell surface expression of fibroblast activator protein (FAP), which diverged into distinct myofibroblasts and pro-fibrotic fibroblast populations, the latter resembling matrifibrocytes. We lineage traced FAP fibroblasts in vivo and showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model tissue fibrosis and demonstrated that 3 different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared to cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand-receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) signaling drove the emergence of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts, the IL-1β ligand in CCR2 monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signaling using a monoclonal antibody and showed fewer pro-fibrotic fibroblasts, decreased cardiac fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. Herein, we characterize fibroblast lineage diversification in the failing heart and showed a subset of macrophages signal to fibroblasts via IL-1β and rewire their gene regulatory network and differentiation trajectory towards a pro-fibrotic fibroblast phenotype.

296,200249258,Mammalian SWI/SNF complex activity regulates POU2F3 and constitutes a targetable dependency in small cell lung cancer,"Small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are comprised of heterogeneous subtypes marked by lineage-specific transcription factors, including ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3. POU2F3-positive SCLC, ~12% of all cases, are uniquely dependent on POU2F3 itself; as such, approaches to attenuate POU2F3 expression may represent new therapeutic opportunities for this subtype. Here using genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9-based screens reporting on POU2F3 expression in SCLC cell lines, we define mSWI/SNF complexes, including non-canonical BAF complexes (ncBAF), as top regulators of POU2F3 and dependencies specific to the POU2F3-positive subtype. Notably, clinical-grade pharmacologic mSWI/SNF complex inhibition attenuates proliferation of all POU2F3-positive SCLCs, while disruption of ncBAF via BRD9 degradation is uniquely effective in pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-SCLCs. mSWI/SNF complexes maintain accessibility over gene loci central to POU2F3-mediated gene regulatory networks. Finally, chemical targeting of SMARCA4/2 mSWI/SNF ATPases and BRD9 decrease POU2F3-SCLC tumor growth and increase survival in vivo.

300,200245807,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [scRNA-Seq],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments. The HMGA1 effects of gene expression go beyond senescence and appear to be relevant in other contexts, such as lung cancer.",Homo sapiens,GSE245807,2024/07/08,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"This dataset focuses on HMGA1's role in chromatin architecture and gene expression in various cancers, including lung cancer.

301,200255782,Mi-2β promotes immune evasion in melanoma by activating EZH2 methylation,"Recent development of new immune checkpoint inhibitors has been particularly successfully in cancer treatment, but still the majority patients fail to benefit. Converting resistant tumors to immunotherapy sensitivity will provide a significant improvement in patient outcome. Here we identify Mi-2β as a key melanoma-intrinsic effector regulating the adaptive anti-tumor immune response. Genetically engineered mouse melanoma studies indicate that loss of Mi-2β rescued the immune response to immunotherapy in vivo. Mechanistically, ATAC-seq indicate that Mi-2β controlled the accessibility of IFN-γ-stimulated genes (ISGs). Mi-2β bound to EZH2 and promote K510 methylation of EZH2 and subsequently activate the trimethylation of H3K27 to inhibit the transcription of ISGs. Finally, we develop an Mi-2β-targeted inhibitor, Z36-MP5, which targeted inhibition of Mi-2β ATPase activity and recovered ISG transcription. Consequently, Z36-MP5 efficiently induce a response to immunotherapy in otherwise resistant melanomas.

303,200265904,GLUT1 overexpression enhances CAR T cell metabolic fitness and anti-tumor efficacy,"The tumor microenvironment presents many obstacles to effective CAR T cell therapy, including glucose competition from tumor and myeloid cells.

In the NALM6 ALL model, 19-28z-GLUT1 promotes Tscm formation and prolongs survival. RNA sequencing of these CAR T cells reveals that overexpression of GLUT1, but not GLUT3, enriches for genes involved in glycolysis, mitochondrial respiration, and memory precursor phenotypes. Extending these data, 19-28z-GLUT1 CAR T cells improve tumor control and response to rechallenge in an RCC patient derived xenograft model.

305,200263176,The thioredoxin system determines CHK1 inhibitor sensitivity via redox-mediated regulation of ribonucleotide reductase activity,"Checkpoint kinase 1 (CHK1) is critical for cell survival under replication stress (RS). CHK1 inhibitors (CHK1i’s) in combination with chemotherapy have shown promising results in preclinical studies but have displayed minimal efficacy with substantial toxicity in clinical trials. To explore combinatorial strategies that can overcome these limitations, we perform an unbiased high-throughput screen in a non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cell line and identify thioredoxin1 (Trx1), a major component of the mammalian antioxidant-system, as a determinant of CHK1i sensitivity. We establish a role for redox recycling of RRM1, the larger subunit of ribonucleotide reductase (RNR), and a depletion of the deoxynucleotide pool in this Trx1-mediated CHK1i sensitivity. Further, the TrxR inhibitor auranofin, an approved anti-rheumatoid arthritis drug, shows a synergistic interaction with CHK1i via interruption of the deoxynucleotide pool.

306,200270858,Intratumoral NKT cell accumulation promotes antitumor immunity in pancreatic cancer,"Here, using the mouse KRT19-deficient (sgKRT19-edited) PDA model, we find that intratumoral accumulation of natural killer T (NKT) cells are required to establish an immunologically active TME. Mechanistically, intratumoral NKT cells facilitate type I interferon (IFN) production to initiate an anti-tumor adaptive immune response, and orchestrate the intratumoral infiltration of T cells, dendritic cells, natural killer cells and myeloid-derived suppressor cells. At the molecular level, NKT cells promote the production of type I IFN through the interaction of their CD40L with CD40 on myeloid cells. To evaluate the theraputical potential of these observations, we find that administration of folinic acid to mice bearing PDA increases NKT cells in the TME and improves their response to anti-PD-1 antibody treatment.

310,200244820,Activation of alveolar epithelial ER stress by b-coronavirus infection disrupts surfactant homeostasis in mice: implications for COVID-19 respiratory failure,"Covid-19 syndrome is characterized by an acute lung injury phenotype marked by hypoxemic respiratory failure and high mortality. Alveolar Type 2 (AT2) cells are essential for gas exchange, repair, and regeneration of distal lung epithelium. We have shown that the causative agent, SARS-CoV-2 and other members of the b coronavirus genus induces an ER stress response in vitro however the consequences for host AT2 cell function in vivo are less understood. To study this, two murine models of coronavirus infection were employed– mouse hepatitis virus-1 (MHV-1) in A/J mice and a C57BL6/j adapted SARS-CoV-2 strain. MHV-1 infected mice exhibited dose-dependent weight loss through Day 8 (8dpi) with histological evidence of distal lung injury accompanied by elevated BALF cell counts and total protein. AT2 cells isolated at 4dpi and 8dpi showed evidence of both viral infection and increases in Bip /GRP78 expression, consistent with activation of the unfolded protein response (UPR). AT2 UPR signaling included elevations in spliced XBP-1 indicating activation of IRE1a signaling as well as a biphasic response in PERK signaling mark by phosphorylated eIF2a protein levels and expression of Atf4, Ppp1r15a, and Ddit3. Viral UPR activation was accompanied by marked reductions in AT2 and BALF surfactant protein (SP-B, SP-C) content, increases in surfactant surface tension, and emergence of a re-programmed epithelial cell population (Krt8+, Cldn4+, and Gdf15+) which was attenuated by treatment with the IRE1a inhibitor OPK711. As proof-of-concept, C57BL6 mice infected with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV-2 demonstrated similar lung injury and evidence of disrupted surfactant homeostasis. We conclude that hypoxic respiratory failure from b-coronavirus infection results from an aberrant AT2 cell host response activating multiple ER stress pathways, altering surfactant metabolism / function, and changing AT2 endophenotypes offering a mechanistic link between SARS-CoV-2 infection, AT2 cell biology, and hypoxemic respiratory failure.",Mus musculus,GSE244820,2024/06/27,2.7,4.0,3.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates the effects of coronavirus infection on lung epithelial cells, which is relevant to lung health and disease.

Using machine learning approaches, we developed a 5hmC signature to predict ICI treatment response and calculated a weighted-predictive score (wp-score) based on the 5hmC levels of signature genes in each sample. A low wp-score was significantly correlated with longer progression-free survival across three independent patient sample sets, and demonstrated superior predictive capability to tumor programmed death-ligand 1.

314,200262409,Blocking the Angiopoietin-2-dependent Integrin beta-1 signaling axis abrogates small cell lung cancer invasion and metastasis,"Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is the most aggressive lung cancer entity with an extremely limited therapeutic outcome. Most patients are diagnosed at an extensive stage. However, the molecular mechanisms driving SCLC invasion and metastasis remain largely elusive. We used an autochthonous SCLC mouse model and matched primary and metastatic SCLC patient samples to investigate the molecular characteristics of tumor metastasis. We demonstrate that tumor cell invasion and liver metastasis in SCLC are triggered by an Angiopoietin-2/Integrin beta-1-dependent pathway in tumor cells, mediated by focal adhesion kinase-Src kinase signaling. Strikingly, CRISPR-Cas9 knock out of Integrin beta-1 or blocking Integrin beta-1 signaling by an anti-Angiopoietin-2 treatment abrogates liver metastasis formation in vivo. Interestingly, analysis of a unique collection of matched primary and metastatic SCLC patient samples confirmed a strong increase of Integrin beta-1 in liver metastasis in comparison to the primary tumor. We further show that Angiopoietin-2 blockade combined with anti-VEGFR and PD-1-targeted treatment displays synergistic treatment effects in SCLC. Together, our data demonstrate a fundamental role of Angiopoietin-2/Integrin beta-1 signaling in SCLC cells for tumor cell invasion and liver metastasis and provide a new effective treatment strategy for patients with SCLC.",Mus musculus,GSE262409,2024/03/28,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset investigates the mechanisms driving invasion and metastasis in small cell lung cancer and explores potential treatment strategies, including immunotherapy.

315,200245248,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS4183_ATAC],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245248,2024/07/01,6.0,6.0,6.0,6.0,"This dataset identifies ferroptosis regulators in lung cancer cells, which is relevant to understanding potential therapeutic vulnerabilities.

316,200263240,Blocking CX3CR1+ Tumor-associated Macrophages Synergize with anti-PD-1 Therapy in Hepatocellular Carcinoma,"The efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICI) in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) treatment remains limited, warranting further investigation into the underlying mechanisms. Accumulating evidence indicates that myeloid cells within the tumor microenvironment (TME) play a role in immune evasion and treatment resistance. In this study, we aimed to explore the contribution of tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) in the HCC TME. Our findings unveil the critical involvement of CX3C motif chemokine receptor 1 (CX3CR1)-positive TAMs in inducing T cell exhaustion through interleukin-27 (IL-27) secretion, providing valuable insights into the mechanisms underlying the suboptimal efficacy of anti-PD-1 therapy in HCC. Additionally, we identified prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) released by immune-attacked tumor cells as a key driver of CX3CR1+ TAM recruitment.

317,200230749,Distinct lactation-associated macrophages exist in murine mammary tissue and human milk [RNA-seq: human],"Macrophages are involved in immune defense, organogenesis and tissue homeostasis. They also contribute to the different phases of mammary gland remodeling during development, pregnancy and involution post-lactation. Yet, less is known about the dynamics of mammary gland macrophages in the lactation stage. Here, we describe a macrophage population present during lactation in mice. By multi-parameter flow cytometry and single-cell RNA sequencing we reveal this population as distinct from the two resident macrophage subsets present pregestationally. These lactation-induced macrophages (LiMacs) are predominantly monocyte-derived and expand by proliferation in situ concomitant with nursing. LiMacs develop independently of IL-34 but require CSF-1 signaling and are partly microbiota-dependent. Locally, they reside adjacent to the basal cells of the alveoli and extravasate into the milk. Moreover, we also found several macrophage subsets in human milk, resembling LiMacs.

CD44hi subpopulation of AT2 cells exhibits higher potential to proliferate and differentiate under steady state conditions. To understand the CD44hi subpopulation of AT2 cells after lung injury, we assessed those cells in a Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) induced mouse model of lung injury. CD44hi and CD44low AT2 cells were FACS sorted from untreated and 3d PA treated mice. In addition, since Sca1+ AT2 cells were shown to emerge during the repair phase of the PA induced injury in our earlier studies, we also isolated Sca1+ AT2 cells at 3d post PA injury to compare with the CD44hi subpopulation.

319,200262074,"Cellular fitness of MYC-driven cancer cells to genetic and pharmacologic perturbations in normoxia, hypoxia and 3D","MYC and hypoxia gene clusters are the two most commonly recurring transcriptional programs in heterogenous tumors. Understanding the cellular fitness of MYC-driven cancer cells in normoxia and hypoxia may lead to identification of distinct cancer cell vulnerabilities. Using genome-wide CRISPR screenings of MYC-driven liver cancer cells cultured over 4 weeks in 21% and 1% oxygen in monolayer, and 21% oxygen in 3D spheroid, we not only identify over 600 essential genes under all three conditions but also context-specific fitness genes and pathways. Knockout of VHL-HIF1 pathway results in incompatible fitness defects under 21% oxygen versus 1% oxygen or 3D. Genetic deletion of each of the mitochondrial respiratory complex I-V has distinct cellular fitness outcomes. Notably, the organogenesis signaling pathways such as TGF-SMAD specifically limits the uncontrolled cell proliferation of 3D spheroids while inactivation of epigenetic modifiers (Bcor, Kmt2d, Mettl3 and Mettl14) has opposite outcomes in monolayer versus 3D. We also discover distinct metabolic requirement for fatty acid and cholesterol synthesis in three conditions.

323,200272104,α-Ketoglutarate Promotes Cardiomyocyte Proliferation and Heart Regeneration after Myocardial Infarction,"The neonatal mammalian heart is capable of substantial regeneration following injury through cardiomyocyte proliferation. However, this regenerative capacity is lost by postnatal (P) day 7. How to stimulate the adult cardiomyocyte to re-enter the cell cycle is still unknown. Accumulating evidence suggests that cardiomyocyte proliferation depends on its metabolic state. Due to the tight connection between the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and cell proliferation, we analyzed the TCA metabolites between P0.5 and P7 mouse hearts and found that α-ketoglutarate (α-KG) ranked first among the decreased metabolites. The intraperitoneal injection of exogenous α-KG extended the window of cardiomyocyte proliferation during heart development and promoted heart regeneration after myocardial infarction (MI) by inducing adult cardiomyocyte proliferation. This was confirmed in Ogdh-siRNA-treated mice with increased α-KG levels. Mechanistically, α-KG activates Jmjd3, a histone lysine demethylase, that decreases H3K27me3 expression and deposition of H3K4me3 at the promoters of cell cycle and structural maturation genes in cardiomyocytes.

324,200250417,Characterization of a suspension Vero cell line for viral vaccine production,"Vero cells, as approved by the World Health Organization, have been the most commonly used continuous cell line for viral vaccine production over the last 25 years, but their adherent phenotype continues to limit productivity. Adapting to a suspension culture would overcome this restriction and reduce production costs. First, a Vero suspension isolate was obtained and metabolically characterized. Second, RNA sequencing analysis was used to identify differentially expressed genes between adherent and suspension cells, which revealed complete downregulation of adhesion and matrix-associated genes. Additionally, signaling pathways involving Wnt and other tyrosine kinase receptors were identified as potential leads for growth optimization. In particular, supplementation with fibroblast growth factor 2 allowed for a 20% increase in cell density. Finally, a comparative viral productivity assay revealed a 30% increase in poliovirus production in suspension Vero cells compared to adherent cells depending on the serotype, as well as a 140% increase in respiratory syncytial virus production and a 150% increase in yellow fever virus production.This work establishes the potential of the suspension Vero cell line as a new cell platform for viral vaccine production.",Chlorocebus sabaeus,GSE250417,2024/06/18,1.3,1.0,2.0,1.0,"This dataset discusses Vero cell lines for viral vaccine production, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

325,200243325,Sequencing analysis of CAR T cell products and apheresis cells in DLBCL patients treated with tandemCAR-T cell,"In this study, 58 r/r DLBCL patients treated with tandem CD19/CD20 CAR T cells. Twenty-seven patients had durational responses for more than 24 months, and the median PFS was 21.7 months. But 15 patients still did not have an objective response, and 11 patients relapsed within 1 year. The analysis found that CD8+TSCM cells with higher frequency and stronger activation ability in CART products were the key to achieving clinical sustained objective response. Bulk RNA-Seq and single-cell RNA-Seq then were performed on CAR-T cell products and pre-manufacture T cells of patients with DLBCL. We note that a CD8+ stem cell-like memory T cell population with a higher proportion and stronger activating capacity of the CAR-T cell products was key to achieving durable clinical response. By analyzing autologously-derived, pre-manufacture T cells, our data suggest that heterogeneity in the cellular and molecular features of pre-manufacture T cells contribute to the variation in efficacy after CAR-T cell therapy in DLBCL. The differences in anti-tumour efficacy of CAR-T cells among patients with different clinical outcomes appear to be due to the loss of CCR7 gene expression accompanied by increased expression of activation- and inhibitor-related genes in the CD8+ naïve-T cell populations among the apheresis T cells from patients with a poor molecular response.

327,200238230,p53 deficient breast cancer cells reprogram pre-adipocytes towards tumor protective immunomodulatory cells (WEA),"The TP53 gene is mutated in approximately 30% of all breast cancer cases. Adipocytes and preadipocytes, which constitute a substantial fraction of the stroma of normal mammary tissue and of breast tumors, undergo transcriptional, metabolic and phenotypic reprogramming during breast cancer development and play an important role in tumor progression. We report here that p53 loss in breast cancer cells facilitates the reprogramming of preadipocytes, inducing them to acquire a unique transcriptional and metabolic program that combines impaired adipocytic differentiation with augmented cytokine expression. This, in turn, promotes the establishment of an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment, including increased abundance of myeloid-derived suppressor cells and elevated expression of the checkpoint ligand PD-L1. We also describe a potential gain-of-function effect of several common p53 missense mutations on the inflammatory reprogramming of preadipocytes. Altogether, our study implicates p53 loss in breast cancer cells as a driver of tumor-supportive adipose tissue reprogramming, expanding the network of non-cell autonomous mechanisms whereby p53 may act as a tumor suppressor. Further elucidation of the interplay between p53 mutations and adipocytes within the tumor microenvironment may suggest novel therapeutic targets for the treatment of breast cancer patients.",Mus musculus,GSE238230,2024/07/01,2.7,3.0,3.0,2.0,"This dataset studies p53 deficient breast cancer cells and their interaction with pre-adipocytes.

Using a single cell RNA-sequencing approach in a genetic model of colorectal cancer (CRC), we identified clock-dependent changes to the immune landscape that dictate the abundance of immunosuppressive cells and consequent suppression of cytotoxic CD8+ T cells. Of these immunosuppressive cell types, PD-L1 expressing myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs) peak in abundance in a rhythmic manner. Mechanistically, we identified that disruption of the epithelial cell clock regulates the secretion of cytokines and chemokines that promote heightened inflammation, recruitment of neutrophils, and the subsequent development of MDSCs. We leveraged these findings to demonstrate that time-of-day delivery of anti-PD-L1 immunotherapy is most effective when synchronized with the abundance of immunosuppressive MDSCs. Collectively, our results indicate that circadian gating of tumor immunosuppression informs the timing and optimal efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs).",Mus musculus,GSE262267,2024/04/22,6.7,6.0,8.0,6.0,"This dataset investigates the circadian control of tumor immunosuppression and its impact on immune checkpoint blockade.

This study aims to evaluate patients with CU after COVID-19 mRNA vaccination. The contribution of SARS-Cov2 infection, atopy and IgE against the vaccine was analyzed. We monitored the features of patients who developed CU after vaccination in the Canton of Vaud through two surveys conducted in 2022 and 2023. Fifty individuals with CU underwent blood tests, and their results were compared with individuals without a history of urticaria (N=135). The presence of anti-vaccine IgE was detected with basophil activation tests (BAT). We assessed anti-SARS-Cov2 humoral response, and the presence of IgEs against common respiratory allergens (Phadiatop) as a surrogate for atopy. Post-vaccination CU occurred after a median interval of 10 days and significantly more after the Spikevax booster, affecting middle-aged individuals (median 41, 66% females). In 2023, CU was still active in 53% of the cases. Inducible forms of CU, primarily dermographism, were reported in 54% (2022) and 61% (2023) of the cases.

333,200268348,The m6A writer KIAA1429 regulates photoaging progression via MFAP4-dependent collagen synthesis,"Background: N6-Methyladenosine (m6A) methylation, a common form of RNA modification, play an important role in the pathogenesis of various diseases and in the ontogeny of organisms. Nevertheless, the precise function of m6A methylation in photoaging remains unknown. Objectives: This study aims to investigate the biological role and underlying mechanism of m6A methylation in photoaging. Methods: m6A dot blot, Real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR), western blot and immunohistochemical (IHC) assays were employed to detect the m6A level and specific m6A methylase in ultraviolet ray (UVR)-induced photoaging tissue. The profile of m6A-tagged mRNA was identified by methylated RNA immunoprecipitation sequencing (MeRIP-seq) and RNA-seq analysis. Finally, we investigated the regulatory mechanism of KIAA1429 by MeRIP-qPCR, RNA knockdown and immunofluorescence assay. Results: m6A levels were increased in photoaging and were closely associated with the upregulation of KIAA1429 expression. 1331 differentially m6A methylated genes were identified in the UVR group compared with the control group, of which 1192 (90%) were hypermethylated. Gene ontology analysis showed that genes with m6A hypermethylation and mRNA downregulation were mainly involved in extracellular matrix metabolism and collagen metabolism-related processes. Furthermore, KIAA1429 knockdown abolished the downregulation of TGF-R and upregulation of MMP1 in UVR-irradiated HDFs. Mechanically, we identified MFAP4 as a target of KIAA1429-mediated m6A modification and KIAA1429 might suppress collagen synthesis through an m6A-MFAP4-mediated process. Conclusions: The increased expression of KIAA1429 hinders collagen synthesis during UVR-induced photoaging, suggesting that KIAA1429 represents a potential candidate for targeted therapy to mitigate UVR-driven photoaging.",Mus musculus,GSE268348,2024/07/16,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates m6A methylation in photoaging, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

334,200168191,The human respiratory airways contain a distinct multipotent secretory cell lineage that can regenerate lung alveoli,"The human lung differs substantially from its murine counterpart, resulting in a distinct distal airway architecture affected by disease pathology in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. In humans, the distal branches of the airway interweave with the alveolar gas exchange niche, forming an anatomical structure known as the respiratory airways. Due to the lack of a murine counterpart, the cellular and molecular characterization of the respiratory airways in the human lung remains an enigma. We show that human respiratory airways contain a unique secretory cell population that is distinct from cells in larger proximal airways. Stem cell modeling reveal that these respiratory airway secretory cells (RASCs) act as unidirectional progenitors for alveolar type 2 cells, which are essential for maintaining and regenerating the alveolar niche. RASC lineage differentiation into AT2 cells is regulated, in part, by Notch signaling. In COPD, RASCs are altered transcriptionally, corresponding to abnormal AT2 cell states. These data identify a distinct progenitor in a region of the human lung not found in mouse that plays a critical role in maintaining the gas exchange compartment and is altered in chronic lung disease.",Homo sapiens,GSE168191,2021/12/09,7.7,8.0,8.0,7.0,"This dataset explores the distinct multipotent secretory cell lineage in human respiratory airways, which is highly relevant to lung biology.

However, the mechanisms which underlie intra-tumor heterogeneity and result in the plethora of different cancer cells within a single lesion remain poorly understood. Here, we leverage the SW480 and SW620 cell lines as a model system to investigate the molecular and functional diversity of colon cancer cells. Through a combination of fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis and transcriptomic profiling, we identify three distinct subpopulations, namely resident cancer stem cells (rCSCs), migratory CSCs (mCSCs), and high-relapse cells (HRCs). These subpopulations show varying Wnt signaling levels and gene expression profiles mirroring their stem-like properties.

Here we apply a combination of single cell RNA sequencing and T/B cell repertoire analysis to perform an in-depth characterization of molecular changes in the immune-signature upon CD19 CAR T cell-mediated depletion of B cells in SLE patients. The resulting datasets do not only confirm a selective CAR T cell-mediated reset of the B cell response, but simultaneously reveal consequent changes in the transcriptional signature of monocyte and T cell subsets that respond with a profound reduction in type 1 interferon signaling. Our current data thus provide evidence for a causal relationship between the B cell response and the increased interferon signature observed in SLE and additionally demonstrate the usefulness of combining targeted therapies and novel analytic approaches to decipher molecular mechanisms of immune-mediated inflammatory diseases in humans.",Homo sapiens,GSE263932,2024/05/13,5.3,5.0,5.0,6.0,"This dataset examines CAR-T cell mediated B cell depletion in systemic lupus erythematosus, which is relevant to immunotherapy.

337,200271371,Differential tumor immune microenvironment coupled with tumor progression or tumor eradication in HPV-antigen expressing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) models.,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) is an etiological factor of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To investigate the role of HPV antigen in anti-tumor immunity, we established mouse models by expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 in a SCC tumor cell line. We obtained two HPV antigen-expressing clones (C-225 and C-100) transplantable into C57BL/6 recipients. We found that C-225 elicited complete eradication in C57BL/6 mice (eradicated), whereas C-100 grew progressively (growing). We examined immune tumor microenvironment (TME) using flow cytometry and found that eradicated or growing tumors exhibited differential immune profiles that may influence the outcome of anti-tumor immunity. Surprisingly, the percentage of CD8 and CD4 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was much higher in growing (C-100) than eradicated (C-225) tumor. However, the TILs upregulated PD-1 and LAG-3 more potently and exhibited impaired effector functions in growing tumor compared to their counterparts in eradicated tumor. C-225 TME is highly enriched with myeloid cells, especially polymorphonuclear (PMN) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), whereas the percentage of M-MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was much higher in C-100 TME, especially M2-TAMs (CD206+). The complete eradication of C-225 depended on CD8 T cells and elicited anti-tumor memory responses upon secondary tumor challenge. We employed DNA sequencing to identify differences in the T cell receptor of peripheral blood lymphocytes pre- and post-secondary tumor challenge. Lastly, C-225 and C-100 tumor lines harbored different somatic mutations. Overall, we uncovered differential immune TME that may underlie the divergent outcomes of anti-tumor immunity by establishing two SCC tumor lines, both of which express HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens. Our experimental models may provide a platform for pinpointing tumor-intrinsic versus host-intrinsic differences in orchestrating an immunosuppressive TME in HNSCCs and for identifying new targets that render tumor cells vulnerable to immune attack.",Mus musculus,GSE271371,2024/07/09,4.0,4.0,4.0,4.0,"This dataset investigates the immune microenvironment in HPV-expressing squamous cell carcinoma models.

338,200205307,Single-cell RNA sequencing reveals myeloid and T cell co-stimulation mediated by IL-7 anti-cancer immunotherapy,"Immune checkpoint inhibitors unleash inhibitory signals on effector T cells inflicted by tumor and surrounding stromal cells. Despite the great success of PD-1 inhibitors in a fraction of cancer patients, lack of checkpoint molecule expression and persistence of immunosuppressive cells limit the effects of the therapy. To overcome the limitations, combination therapies or direct stimulation of myeloid cells are being investigated. Nonetheless, combination therapies increase the incidence of side effects, and a single agent co-stimulating T cell and myeloid populations might be a better strategy. Exploring single cell RNA sequencing data from multiple human cancers and mouse tumor model, we found pleiotropic expression of interleukin 7 receptor on T cells, macrophages, and dendritic cells. Treatment of recombinant IL7 induced expansion of effector CD8 T cells along with pro-inflammatory activation of macrophages and dendritic cells. Spatial transcriptomic data revealed strengthen of anti-tumoral interactions between macrophages and T cells by IL7 treatment.

339,200225020,Intrinsic tumor resistance to CAR T-cells is a dynamic transcriptional state that can be exploited with low dose radiation,"Purpose: High tumor burden prior to CAR T-cell therapy predicts poor outcome, however it is unclear if this is driven more by cell number or underlying biology. It is also unclear if tumor intrinsic properties that confer CAR T-cell resistance can be clinically manipulated to improve response. Here we capitalize on radiation’fering effects by dose in vivo to examine the relative importance of tumor quantity versus quality prior to CAR T-cell therapy. Experimental Design: Using Nalm6 ALL tumor-bearing mice, we investigate the impact of high dose (20Gy in 5 fractions) radiation to focal bulky disease, versus less cytotoxic low-dose (1.8Gy) to all disease (total tumor irradiation; TTI) on CAR T-cell efficacy. We characterize the dynamics of predictive transcriptional states in mice and patients using tumor RNA-seq under conditions of excellent vs poor response. Results: We find the in vivo sensitivity of leukemia cells to CAR T-cells is not only predicted by a transcriptional score, but this score can be temporarily increased by low dose TTI, which is associated with significantly improved survival. Focal high dose radiation (as is currently done clinically) was more debulking but did not improve survival. The tumor transcriptional state induced by low dose radiation was found in >80% of long-term CAR T-cell survivors. Conclusions: These findings provide a path to 1) identify patients unlikely to respond to CAR T_x0002_cells due to potentially reversible tumor-intrinsic resistance, and 2) potentially improve response using low dose TTI to adjust a tumor’s unfavorable transcriptional state prior to CAR T-cell delivery.",Homo sapiens,GSE225020,2023/09/27,5.7,5.0,7.0,5.0,"This dataset explores tumor resistance to CAR T-cells and the effects of radiation on this resistance.

340,200267436,Cancer-associated SF3B1-K700E mutation controls immune responses by regulating Treg function via aberrant Anapc13 splicing,"Recurrent somatic mutations in spliceosome factor 3b subunit 1 (SF3B1) are identified in hematopoietic cell-derived malignancies, with SF3B1-K700E being the most common one. Here we show that Treg specific expression of SF3B1-K700E (Sf3b1K700Efl/+/Foxp3YFP-Cre) results in spontaneous autoimmune phenotypes including enlarged spleen and tissue infiltration with IFN-γ-producing CD4+ T cells. CD4+ T cells from Sf3b1K700Efl/+/Foxp3YFP-Cre mice display defective Treg differentiation and inhibitory function, which is demonstrated by failed prevention of adoptive transfer colitis by Sf3b1K700Efl/+/Foxp3YFP-Cre Tregs. Mechanically, SF3B1-K700E induces an aberrant splicing event that results in reduced expression of a cell proliferation regulator Anapc13 due to insertion a 231 bp DNA fragment to the 5’ untranslated region (UTR). Forced expression of Anapc13 gene restores the differentiation and ability of Sf3b1K700Efl/+/Foxp3YFP-Cre Tregs to prevent adoptive transfer colitis.

341,200246740,MBNL1 regulates programmed postnatal switching between regenerative and differentiated cardiac states [scRNA-seq],"Background: Discovering determinants of cardiomyocyte maturity will be critical to understanding the maintenance of differentiated states and potentially reawakening endogenous regenerative programs in adult mammalian hearts as a therapeutic strategy. Recent evidence has suggested that forced dedifferentiation paired with oncogene expression is sufficient to drive cardiac regeneration. However, elucidation of endogenous developmental determinants of the switch between regenerative and mature cardiomyocyte cell states is necessary for optimal design of regenerative approaches for heart disease. Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) regulates both fibroblast and erythroid differentiation and proliferation. Hence, we examined whether MBNL1 promotes and maintains mature cardiomyocyte states while antagonizing cardiomyocyte proliferation. Methods: MBNL1 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models were studied at several developmental timepoints and in surgical models of heart regeneration. Multi-omics approaches were combined with biochemical, histological, and in vitro genetic work to determine the mechanisms through which MBNL1 exerts its effects. Results: MBNL1 is co-expressed with a maturation-association genetic program in the heart and is regulated by the MEIS1/Calcineurin signaling axis. Targeted MBNL1 overexpression early in development prematurely transitioned cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic growth, hypoplasia, and dysfunction, while loss of MBNL1 function increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and proliferation through altered cell cycle inhibitor transcript stability. Moreover, MBNL1-dependent stabilization of estrogen-related receptor signaling was essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte maturity in adult myocytes. In accordance with these data, modulating MBNL1 dose tuned the temporal window of neonatal cardiac regeneration, where increased MBNL1 expression arrested myocyte proliferation and regeneration, and MBNL1 deletion promoted regenerative states with prolonged myocyte proliferation. However, MBNL1 deletion was not sufficient to promote regeneration in the adult heart due to cell-cycle checkpoint activation. Conclusions: Here, MBNL1 was identified as an essential regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiated states, their developmental switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth, and their regenerative potential through controlling an entire maturation program by stabilizing adult myocyte mRNAs during postnatal development and throughout adulthood. Additionally, MBNL1-dependent perturbations of a myocyte’s preferred growth mechanism at a given developmental state had detrimental consequences to cardiac function, and targeting loss of maturity and removing cell cycle inhibitors was not insufficient to promote adult regeneration.",Mus musculus,GSE246740,2024/03/07,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on cardiac regeneration and the role of MBNL1 in cardiomyocyte states.

342,200184384,Epithelial Plasticity and Innate Immune Activation Promote Lung Tissue Remodeling following Respiratory Viral Infection.,"As observed in mice with genetic depletion of stem cells, epithelial plasticity is a critical component of tissue repair in response to injury; however, the physiological relevance of this process and the involved progenitor populations are not well understood. Severe respiratory viral infection and chronic lung disease share pathological features including stem cell loss in the gas-exchange regions, basal cell (BC) hyperplasia in small airways, and innate immune activation. Collectively, these processes contribute to epithelial remodeling and loss of diffusion capacity. Here, we show that small airways harbor a previously undescribed lineage of secretory cells, intralobar serous (IS) cells, that are activated to assume BC fates following influenza virus infection. Nascent BC were distinguished from pre-existing BC by high expression of IL-22Ra1 and a dependency on innate immune activation and local IL-22 production for self-renewal and colonization of injured alveoli. Resolution of virus-elicited inflammation and the associated decline in IL-22 signaling resulted in basal to serous re-differentiation in repopulated alveoli, and increased local expression of antimicrobial factors, but failed to replace normal alveolar epithelium. We define a mechanism whereby epithelial plasticity confers protection against mortality from acute respiratory viral infection but has potential to contribute to progressive lung remodeling and life-threatening declines in lung function among patients with chronic lung disease.",Mus musculus,GSE184384,2023/08/08,4.3,5.0,4.0,4.0,"This dataset explores epithelial plasticity and immune activation in lung tissue following viral infection, which could relate to lung cancer pathology.

344,200240388,Astrocytes modulate a specific paraventricular thalamus-prefrontal cortex projection to enhance consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia in mice,"Previous studies have proved that astrocytes may be a key neural substrate that regulates wakefulness and consciousness recovery from general anesthesia, while the exact molecular target in astrocytes is still unclear. Using virus injection and in vivo fiber photometry in mice, we found both activating astrocytes and knocking down astrocytic Kir4.1 in paraventricular thalamus (PVT) promotes the consciousness recovery from sevoflurane anesthesia. Single-cell RNA sequencing of PVT reveals two distinct cellular subtypes of glutamatergic neurons: PVTGRM and PVTChAT neurons. Patch-clamp recording results proved that Astrocytic Kir4.1-mediated modulation of sevoflurane on PVT mainly works on PVTChAT neurons. Moreover, we found that PVTChAT neurons project mainly to the mPFC. This specific paraventricular thalamus to prefrontal cortex projection is involved in recovery of consciousness from sevoflurane anesthesia indirectly through modulation of astrocytes.

345,200197595,In vivo CRISPR screens identify dual function of MEN1 in regulating tumor-microenvironment interactions,"Functional genomic screen in 2D cell culture is limited in identifying therapeutic targets that modulates tumor-microenvironment interaction. Through comparison of targeted CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 2D cell culture and cell line derived xenografts of lung cancer A549, we identified MEN1 as the top hit that confers differential essentialities in vitro and in vivo. Knockout of MEN1 in multiple solid cancer types does not impact cell proliferation in vitro, but significantly promotes and inhibits tumor growth in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, respectively. Mechanistically, knockout of MEN1 leads to redistribution of its interaction partner MLL1, a histone methyltransferase, to repetitive genomic regions that produce double stranded RNA. This resulted in MARV and cGAS-STING dependent activation of viral mimicry response, which induces tumor promoting neutrophil and tumor suppressing CD8+ T cell infiltrations in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, respectively. Consistently, multiple immune cell infiltrations are negatively correlated with MEN1 abundance and positively correlated with that of MLL1 in patient tumors of a broad range of cancer types. Pharmacological inhibition of MEN1-MLL1 interaction reduces tumor growth in CD8+ T cell dependent manner, and synergizes with anti-PD-L1 treatment.

349,200271698,B cell-intrinsic IFN-g promotes CD11c+ age-associated B cell differentiation and compromises affinity-based germinal center selection in lupus,"Lupus patients respond less efficiently to vaccinations and are more susceptible to infections. Previously, we have shown, in lupus models, that excessive CD11c+ age-associated B cells (ABCs) not only contribute to autoantibody production but also compromise antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cell selection and affinity maturation by promoting aberrant T cell activation. Yet, how CD11c+ ABC differentiation is regulated is not fully understood. Here we show that B cell-intrinsic IFN-γ is required for excessive CD11c+ ABC differentiation in lupus mice. B cell-intrinsic IFN-γ is mainly produced by CD11c+ ABCs.

353,200220720,Real time quantitative PCR analysis of human biliary epithelial cells,"Biliary complications are disabling conditions that arise in up to 25% of liver transplanted patients, resulting in additional surgical procedures, re-transplantation or, in the absence of a suitable regraft, death. Here, we investigate the role of the primary cilia, a highly-specialised sensory organelle, in biliary injury leading to biliary complications. Human biopsies were used to study the structure and function of primary cilia in liver transplant recipients that develop biliary complications (N=7), compared to successful transplants (N=12). To study the biological effects of the primary cilia during transplantation, we used murine models that recapitulate liver procurement and cold storage conditions, and the K19CreERT Kif3a flox/flox mouse model to conditionally eliminate primary cilia in cholangiocytes. Microarray and RNA-seq analysis were used to study these biological effects at the transcriptional level. To explore the molecular mechanisms responsible for the observed phenotypes, we used in vitro models of ischemia, cellular senescence and primary cilia ablation. Pharmacological and genetic approaches were used to target cellular senescence and the primary cilia, in mouse models and human donor livers. Prolonged ischemic periods pre-transplantation result in ciliary shortening and cellular senescence. Primary cilia damage results in biliary injury and a loss of regenerative potential. Initiation of senescence negatively primary cilia structure, establishing a negative feedback loop that further impairs regeneration.

356,200241979,IFN -induced Immunosuppression in Lung Carcinoma is Mediated by an Environmental Chemical Receptor (AhR) through PD-L1 and IDO Control (cmt167 scRNA),"While immunotherapy has shown efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, many respond only partially or not at all. One limitation in improving outcomes is the lack of a complete understanding of factors regulating immune checkpoint targets. Here, we sought to address a possible link between an environmental chemical receptor implicated in NSCLC and immune regulation, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and a known but counterintuitive mediator of immunosuppression, IFN , in regulation of two immune checkpoints, PD-L1 and the IDO1, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). To this end we used AhR, PD-L1, and IFN R gene-edited LUAD cell lines, a syngeneic LUAD mouse model, bulk- and single cell-RNA sequencing of LUADs and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, and existing human transcriptomic databases. The data demonstrate that: 1) the AhR regulates both PD-L1 and IDO1 in murine and human LUAD cells, 2) AhR-driven IDO1 results in production of Kyn which likely mediates an AhR→IDO1→Kyn→AhR amplification loop, 3) the previously characterized induction by IFN of PD-L1 and IDO is mediated by the AhR, 4) transplantation of LUAD cells in which the AhR is deleted results in long-term tumor immunity in approximately half of the mice; slow growing tumors in the other half exhibit significantly higher densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing immunocompetence markers, and 5) deletion of either IFN R1 or PD-L1 does not provide the same level of immune protection as AhR deletion.

358,200245247,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS4182_ATAC],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245247,2024/07/01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset investigates ferroptosis in cancer cells, which does not specifically address lung cancer or immunotherapy, leading to minimal relevance.","This dataset focuses on ferroptosis in cancer cells, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

359,200190274,SMARCB1 loss defines a novel PTCL-NOS subtype displaying an immunosuppressive TME susceptible to HDAC inhibitors [single-cell RNA-seq],"Peripheral T-cell lymphoma, not otherwise specified (PTCL-NOS) are aggressive and heterogeneous tumors with poor outcome and scarce genetic characterization. We analyzed by immunohistochemistry tumor tissue of adult and pediatric PTCL-NOS patients and discovered frequent loss of SMARCB1 positivity, mostly associated with pediatric cases (45%). Using a genetically engineered mouse model (PTCL-NOSSmarcb1-) and single-cell RNA sequencing, we investigated the transcriptional landscape of this Smarcb1-negative PTCL-NOS tumor and the functional interactions between tumor and tumor microenvironment (TME). We unrevealed an immunosuppressive, exhausted and proinflammatory TME, characterized by high myeloid cell infiltration (predominantly myeloid derived suppressor cells, MDSC) and reduced lymphoid infiltration. In addition, using a multidrug epigenetic screen in vitro, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) as promising agents against PTCL-NOSSmarcb1-. Treatment of PTCL-NOSSmarcb1- mice with SAHA, a pan-HDACi, triggered TME remodelling, promoting the replenishment of T- and B-cell compartments and the limitation/reversion of the exhaustion phenotype. In conclusion, we have identified a novel PTCL-NOS subtype characterized by the loss of SMARCB1 at pediatric ages, presenting an exhausted and immunosuppressive TME. Administration of SAHA reshaped the TME increasing lymphoid cells recruitment into the tumor bed, turning the tumor from cold to hot.

360,200263994,Single-cell RNA transcriptome defines the signaling networks regulated by ACE2 in cornea,"For decades, it has been well accepted that corneal epithelial stem cells and their immediate progeny, the early transit amplifying (eTA) cells, reside in the limbal epithelial basal layer. Activation of quiescent stem/eTA cells is required for proper re-epithelialization during wound healing. The molecular profile of activated stem/eTA cells remains unclear because of difficulties in obtaining discrete cell populations for analyses. Single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) technology can profile the transcriptome at a single cell level, providing information on how stem/eTA cell activation is regulated. Using this technology, we report that ACE2, a key component in the renin-angiotensin system (RAS), functions as a negative regulator of stem/eTA activation. Methods: Mouse corneal epithelium was exposed to 1M NaOH for 30s or mechanically removed with a diamond burr. Corneas were processed for scRNA-seq and data was analyzed using R with a Seurat package. Limbal epithelial cell proliferation was assessed using BrdU incorporation. RT-qPCR, western blotting and immunostaining were conducted to determine the change of gene expression. Results: ACE2 was predominantly expressed in the stem cell-enriched limbal basal epithelium. scRNA-seq combined with GO analysis suggested that ACE2 was involved in limbal stem/eTA cell proliferation. Interestingly, immunostaining and RT-qPCR indicated that ACE2 expression was reduced following corneal injuries. Reduction in ACE2 promoted proliferation in human limbal epithelial cell culture as well as in mouse limbal epithelium after corneal epithelial debridement. Significantly, the negative effect of ACE2 on proliferation was not reversed following treatment with the angiotensin II receptor blocker losartan, indicating that the function of ACE2 in limbal epithelium is independent of RAS. scRNA-seq also revealed that reduction of ACE2 caused activation of the TGFA/EGFR pathway, which reduced expression of Lcn2. Lcn2 is a negative regulator of proliferation in a variety of cells. Inhibition of EGFR or overexpression of Lcn2 reversed the increased proliferation in limbal epithelial cells lacking ACE2. Conclusion: Our findings strongly support the idea that in response to corneal injury, ACE2 is downregulated, which results in the activation of stem/eTA cell proliferation via a novel TGFA/EGFR/Lcn2 signaling pathway in an angiotensin-independent way.",Mus musculus,GSE263994,2024/07/15,0.3,1.0,0.0,0.0,"The dataset focuses on corneal epithelial stem cells and the role of ACE2 in their activation, which is not related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

361,200263696,The unique catalytic properties of PSAT1 mediate metabolic adaptation to glutamine blockade,"Cultured cancer cells frequently rely on the consumption of glutamine and its subsequent hydrolysis to glutamate by the mitochondrial enzyme glutaminase (GLS). However, this metabolic addiction can be lost in the tumor microenvironment (TME), rendering GLS inhibitors ineffective in the clinic. Here, we show that seemingly glutamine-addicted breast cancer cells ultimately adapt to chronic glutamine starvation, or targeted GLS inhibition, via the AMPK-mediated upregulation of the serine synthesis pathway (SSP). In this context, the key product of the SSP is not serine itself, but a-ketoglutarate (a-KG). Mechanistically, we find that the phylogenetically distinct transaminase phosphoserine aminotransferase 1 (PSAT1) has a unique capacity for sustained a-KG production when glutamate is severely depleted. Breast cancer cells with intrinsic or acquired resistance to glutamine starvation or GLS inhibition are highly dependent on SSP-supplied a-KG. Accordingly, pharmacological disruption of the SSP prevents adaptation to glutamine blockade, yielding a potent drug synergism that abolishes breast tumor growth in vivo. These findings highlight how metabolic redundancy can be context dependent, with the catalytic properties of different metabolic enzymes that act on the same substrate determining which pathways can support tumor growth in a particular nutrient environment. This in turn has practical consequences for therapies targeting cancer metabolism.",Homo sapiens,GSE263696,2024/07/05,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset investigates metabolic adaptation in breast cancer cells, which is somewhat related to cancer biology but does not specifically address lung cancer or immunotherapy.

366,200239389,Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 inhibits proliferation and metabolism in non–small cell lung cancer cells in HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manner,"Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-α. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF.

We unrevealed an immunosuppressive, exhausted and proinflammatory TME, characterized by high myeloid cell infiltration (predominantly myeloid derived suppressor cells, MDSC) and reduced lymphoid infiltration. In addition, using a multidrug epigenetic screen in vitro, we identified histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi) as promising agents against PTCL-NOSSmarcb1-. Treatment of PTCL-NOSSmarcb1- mice with SAHA, a pan-HDACi, triggered TME remodelling, promoting the replenishment of T- and B-cell compartments and the limitation/reversion of the exhaustion phenotype. In conclusion, we have identified a novel PTCL-NOS subtype characterized by the loss of SMARCB1 at pediatric ages, presenting an exhausted and immunosuppressive TME. Administration of SAHA reshaped the TME increasing lymphoid cells recruitment into the tumor bed, turning the tumor from cold to hot.

372,200212453,Vaccine-primed CAR T-cells reject antigen-heterogenous tumors via host immunity,"Chimeric Antigen Receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy effectively treats human cancer, but loss of the antigen recognized by the CAR poses a major obstacle. We found that in vivo vaccine boosting of CAR T-cells triggers engagement of the endogenous immune system to circumvent antigen-negative tumor escape. Vaccine-boosted CAR-T promoted dendritic cell (DC) recruitment to tumors, increased tumor antigen uptake by DCs, and elicited priming of endogenous anti-tumor T-cells (antigen spreading). This process was accompanied by shifts in CAR-T metabolism toward oxidative phosphorylation and was critically dependent on CAR T-derived IFN-γ. Antigen spreading induced by vaccine-boosted CAR T enabled a proportion of complete responses even when the initial tumor was 50% CAR-antigen-negative, and heterogenous tumor control was further enhanced by genetically amplifying CAR T IFN-γ expression. Thus, CAR T-cell-derived IFN-γ plays a critical role in promoting antigen spreading, and vaccine boosting provides a clinically-translatable strategy to drive such responses against solid tumors.",Mus musculus,GSE212453,2023/05/17,6.7,5.0,7.0,8.0,"This dataset discusses CAR T-cell therapy, which is a form of immunotherapy, but it does not specifically focus on lung cancer.

In this pilot study, we exposed two pigtail macaques (PTMs) chronically infected with SIVmac239, exhibiting from very low to no CD4 T cells across all compartments, to SARS-CoV-2. We monitored the disease progression, viral replication and evolution, and compared these outcomes with SIV-naïve PTMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. No overt signs of COVID-19 disease were observed in either animal, and the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and evolution in the SIVmac239 PTMs were indistinguishable from those in the SIV-naïve PTMs in all sampled mucosal sites. However, the single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells revealed an infiltration of functionally inert monocytes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Critically, neither of the SIV-infected PTMs mounted detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses nor anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding or neutralizing antibodies.

377,200240757,A plasma miRNA-based classifier for small cell lung cancer diagnosis [miRNA-Seq],"Objectives: Small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is characterized by poor prognosis and challenging diagnosis. Screening in high-risk smokers results in a reduction in lung cancer mortality, however, screening efforts are primarily focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). SCLC diagnosis and surveillance remain significant challenges. The aberrant expression of circulating microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) is reported in many tumors and can provide insights into the pathogenesis of tumor development and progression. Here, we conducted a comprehensive assessment of circulating miRNAs in SCLC with a goal of developing a miRNA-based biomarker classifier to assist in SCLC diagnoses. Materials and Methods: We profiled deregulated circulating cell-free miRNA in the plasma of SCLC patients. We tested selected miRs on a training cohort and created a classifier by integrating miRNA expression and patient clinical data. Finally, we applied the classifier on a validation dataset. Results: We determined that miR-375-3p can discriminate between SCLC and NSCLC patients, and between SCLC and Squamous Cell Carcinoma patients. Moreover, we found that a model comprising miR-375-3p, miR-320b, and miR-144-3p can be integrated with race and age to distinguish metastatic SCLC from a control group.

We previously established long-term expanding human lung epithelial organoids from lung tissues and developed a ‘proximal’ differentiation protocol to generate mucociliary airway organoids, yet the derivation of alveolar organoids from adult lung has remained a challenge. Here we defined a ‘distal’ differentiation approach to generate alveolar organoids from the same source that allows the establishment of airway organoids. Alveolar organoids are enriched for AT1 and AT2 cells and functionally simulate the alveolar epithelium. AT2 cells in lung organoids act as the progenitor cells from which alveolar organoids emerge. Moreover, we demonstrate productive SARS-CoV-2 infection of alveolar organoids. We further optimize 2-dimensional (2D) airway organoids. When differentiated under a slightly acidic pH, these 2D airway organoids sustain enhanced viral replication and better recapitulate the high infectivity of SARS-CoV-2.

379,200247054,A pair of NUCLEAR FACTOR Y transcription factors act as positive regulators in jasmonate signaling and disease resistance in Arabidopsis,"The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) regulates plant growth and immunity by orchestrating a genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming. In the resting stage, JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as main repressors to regulate the expression of JA-responsive genes in the JA signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying de-repression of JA-responsive genes in response to JA treatment remain elusive. Here, we report two nuclear factor Y transcription factors NF- YB2 and NF-YB3 (thereafter YB2 and YB3) play key roles in such de-repression in Arabidopsis. YB2 and YB3 function redundantly and positively regulate plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea ， which are specially required for transcriptional activation of a set of JA-responsive genes following inoculation. Furthermore, YB2 and YB3 modulated their expression through direct occupancy and interaction with histone demethylase Ref6 to remove repressive histone modifications. Moreover, YB2 and YB3 physically interacted with JAZ repressorsand negatively modulated their abundance, which in turn attenuated the inhibition of JAZ proteins on the transcription of JA- responsive genes, thereby activating JA response and promoting disease resistance.

A molecular understanding of alveologenesis remains incomplete. Here, we show that the autonomic nerve and alveolar myofibroblast form a functional unit in mice. Myofibroblasts secrete neurotrophins to promote neurite extension/survival, whereas neurotransmitters released from autonomic terminals are necessary for myofibroblast proliferation and migration, a key step in alveologenesis. This establishes a functional link between autonomic innervation and alveolar formation. We also discover that planar cell polarity (PCP) signaling employs a Wnt-Fz/Ror-Vangl cascade to regulate the cytoskeleton and neurotransmitter trafficking/release from the terminals of autonomic nerves. This represents a new aspect of PCP signaling in conferring cellular properties. Together, these studies offer molecular insight into how autonomic activity controls alveolar formation.

382,200270788,Targeting Immune-Fibroblast Crosstalk in Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Fibrosis III,"Inflammation and tissue fibrosis co-exist and are causally linked to organ dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms driving immune-fibroblast crosstalk in human cardiac disease remains unexplored, and there are currently no approved treatments that directly target cardiac fibrosis. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping, and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 donors, acutely infarcted, and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory marked by cell surface expression of fibroblast activator protein (FAP), which diverged into distinct myofibroblasts and pro-fibrotic fibroblast populations, the latter resembling matrifibrocytes. We lineage traced FAP fibroblasts in vivo and showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model tissue fibrosis and demonstrated that 3 different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared to cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand-receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) signaling drove the emergence of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts, the IL-1β ligand in CCR2 monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signaling using a monoclonal antibody and showed fewer pro-fibrotic fibroblasts, decreased cardiac fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. Herein, we characterize fibroblast lineage diversification in the failing heart and showed a subset of macrophages signal to fibroblasts via IL-1β and rewire their gene regulatory network and differentiation trajectory towards a pro-fibrotic fibroblast phenotype.

384,200241673,Tumor- and circulating-free DNA methylation identifies clinically relevant small cell lung cancer subtypes,"Small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an aggressive malignancy composed of distinct transcriptional subtypes, each with unique therapeutic vulnerabilities. Implementing subtyping in the clinic has remained challenging due to limited tissue availability, particularly for longitudinal monitoring. Given the known epigenetic regulation of critical SCLC transcriptional programs, we hypothesized that there would be subtype-specific patterns of DNA methylation that could be detected in tumor or blood from SCLC patients. Using genomic-wide reduced-representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) in two cohorts of totally 179 SCLC patients and machine learning approaches, we developed a highly accurate DNA methylation-based classifier (SCLC-DMC) that could distinguish SCLC subtypes using clinical tumor samples with 95.8% accuracy in the testing set compared to mRNA-based profiling. We further adjusted the classifier for circulating-free DNA (cfDNA) to subtype SCLC from plasma. Using the cfDNA classifier (cfDMC) we could demonstrate that SCLC phenotypes can evolve during disease progression, highlighting the need for longitudinal tracking of SCLC during clinical treatment. Furthermore, methylation-based subtyping predicted response to a wide variety of drugs in preclinical models and clinical outcomes were indistinguishable in cohorts of patients subtyped using mRNA or SCLC-DMC.

386,200268393,Spinal motor neuron development and metabolism are transcriptionally regulated by Nuclear Factor IA [ChIP-Seq],"Neural circuits governing complex motor behaviors in vertebrates rely on the proper development of motor neurons and their precise targeting of limb muscles. Transcription factors are essential for motor neuron development, regulating their specification, migration, and axonal targeting. While transcriptional regulation of the early stages of motor neuron specification is well-established, much less is known about the role of transcription factors in the later stages of maturation and terminal arborization. Defining the molecular mechanisms of these later stages is critical for elucidating how motor circuits are constructed. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nuclear Factor-IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation. Moreover, we find that NFIA is required for proper mitochondrial function and ATP production, providing a new and important link between transcription factors and metabolism during motor neuron development.

Key considerations in the development of allogeneic CAR-T cell therapies include prevention of GvHD and suppression of allograft rejection. Here we describe preclinical data supporting the ongoing first-in-human clinical trial (CaMMouflage) in relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma patients evaluating CB-011, a hypoimmunogenic, allogeneic anti–B cell maturation antigen (BCMA) CAR-T cell therapy candidate. CB-011 cells feature 4 genomic alterations and were engineered from healthy donor-derived T cells using a Cas12a CRISPR hybrid RNA-DNA (chRDNA) genome-editing technology platform. To address allograft rejection, CAR-T cells were engineered to prevent endogenous human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I complex expression and overexpress a single-chain polyprotein complex composed of beta-2 microglobulin (B2M) tethered to HLA-E. Additionally, T cell receptor expression was disrupted at the T cell receptor alpha constant locus in combination with the site-specific insertion of a humanized BCMA-specific CAR.

390,200236719,Synthetic essentiality of thymine DNA glycosylase in p53-deficient cancer [ChIP-seq],"Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) is a versatile protein involved in DNA mismatch repair, DNA demethylation, and transcriptional regulation. Here, we identify TDG as a synthetic essential effector in p53-deficient tumours. We found that deletion of TDG inhibits cell proliferation specifically in p53-deficient cancer cells. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we demonstrate that depletion of TDG suppresses tumour growth in the p53-deficient context. Notably, A novel and selective inhibitor developed to disrupt the DNA binding activity of TDG exhibits therapeutic efficacy against p53-deficient tumours in both cellular and xenograft models. Mechanistically, TDG coordinates with p53 to orchestrate the transcription of RNA helicase DHX9, which functions to eliminate dsRNA. Depletion of TDG in p53-deficient cells results in the downregulation of DHX9 and aberrant cytoplasmic double-strand (dsRNA) accumulation derived from Alu elements, subsequently activating the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS mediated antiviral response. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the depletion of TDG in p53-deficient tumours facilitates the recruitment of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. We observed that TDG inhibition combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) achieved a strong synergistic anti-tumour effect in p53-deficient tumours. This study highlights the function of TDG in maintaining p53-deficient tumour growth and provides an alternative therapeutic target for p53-deficient cancers.",Mus musculus; Homo sapiens,GSE236719,2024/06/21,7.3,6.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset investigates the role of thymine DNA glycosylase in p53-deficient tumors, including lung adenocarcinoma.

392,200245060,Chronic and acute exposure to rotenone lead to distinct Parkinson’s disease-related phenotypes in human iPSC-derived peripheral neurons,"Peripheral autonomic nervous system (P-ANS) dysfunction is a critical non-motor phenotype of Parkinson's disease (PD). While the majority of PD cases are sporadic with no identified PD-associated genes involved, epidemiological and animal model studies suggest an association with pesticides and other environmental toxins but underlying cellular mechanisms affecting the human P-ANS is unclear. Here, we mapped the global transcriptome changes in human induced-pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) derived P-ANS sympathetic neurons followed by exposure to the PD-related pesticide, rotenone. Surprisingly, we revealed distinct transcriptome profiles between acute and chronic exposure to rotenone. In the acute stage, there was a down regulation of specific cation channel genes mediating action potential signaling, while in the chronic stage, the human P-ANS neurons exhibited dysregulation of anti-apoptotic and Golgi apparatus-related pathways. Moreover, we identified the sodium voltage-gated channel subunit SCN3A/Nav1.3 as a potential biomarker in human P-ANS neurons associated with PD. Our analysis of the rotenone-altered coding and non-coding genome of human P-ANS neurons may thus provide insight into the pathological signaling events that occur in the sympathetic neurons during PD progression.",Homo sapiens,GSE245060,2024/06/11,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,This dataset studies Parkinson's disease-related phenotypes and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

393,200245243,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3790_scATAC],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245243,2024/07/01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"This dataset investigates ferroptosis and its regulation, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

395,200222673,Tumor-derived kynurenine induces Siglec-15 expression and promotes CD8+T cell exhaustion in oral squamous cell carcinoma,"Metabolic deregulation and immune escape are pivotal hallmarks of cancer; however, the profile of metabolic reprogramming in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and how it drives immune escape remain unclear. We identified significant metabolic disorders in OSCC. Amino acid metabolism, especially tryptophan/kynurenine metabolism, was altered. Here, we found that kynurenine promotes migration, invasion, and proliferation in vitro and in vivo. In addition, most immune checkpoints were upregulated in patients with high kynurenine levels. We then identified that kynurenine can promote Siglec-15 expression via AhR activation. Furthermore, tumor-derived kynurenine can directly exhaust CD8+ T cells, whereas blocking of kynurenine transporters reversed this effect. Moreover, we found that ectopic expression of Siglec-15 can promote immune escape in tumor microenvironment (TME) by suppressing T cell infiltration and inducing CD8+ T cell exhaustion in vivo, while targeting AhR reduces kynurenine-mediated immune escape. Finally, we design NH2-MSNs nanoparticles to deliver Siglec-15 small interfering RNA, which successfully remodels the TME and enhances anti-PD-1 efficacy in tumor-bearing immunocompetent mice. Clinically, Siglec-15 expression is correlated with AhR expression and high infiltration of exhausted CD8+ T cells. These findings reveal that the Kyn/AhR/Siglec-15 signaling pathway is a novel immunometabolism mechanism in OSCC, thus opening a new therapeutic avenue for metabolic immunotherapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE222673,2024/07/03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"This dataset studies oral squamous cell carcinoma and its immune escape mechanisms, which are unrelated to lung cancer.

396,200209647,Transcriptomic studies on ruxolitinib with or without checkpoint inhibitors as a cancer therapy,"Unleashing anti-tumor T cell activity by checkpoint inhibition is effective in many cancer patients but clinical response rates remain limited. Myeloid derived suppressor cells erode antitumor lymphocyte numbers and function, and correlate with resistance to checkpoint inhibitors. By screening small molecule libraries, we identified JAK inhibitors’ ability to rescue T cell function. Despite its documented immune suppressive properties, the prototypical JAK inhibitor ruxolitinib enhanced the efficacy of immune checkpoint blockade in cancer. This effect correlated with loss of suppressive gene expression, and acquisition of immunostimulatory molecular markers and T cell stimulatory activity in myeloid cells. In preclinical models, ruxolitinib significantly improved the function and increased the total numbers of activated tumor-infiltrating NK and CD4 T cells compared to checkpoint blockade alone and the efficacy was conditional on granulocytic cells. In addition to myeloid reprogramming in the tumor, ruxolitinib blunts G-CSF signaling in the bone marrow to prevent expression of suppressive and chemotaxis genes in neutrophils.",Mus musculus,GSE209647,2024/06/20,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,This dataset investigates the effects of ruxolitinib in cancer therapy but does not focus on lung cancer or immunotherapy.

397,200236418,LINC01770 mediates nasopharyngeal cancer radiation resistance and renders tumor cell vulnerable to ferroptosis [RNA-seq],"Long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) participate in regulation of various essential biological processes including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis, migration, and invasion. However, the clinical significances of lncRNAs and their functions and mechanisms in nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) involved in malignant progression need to be further investigated. We find that the LINC01770-TEAD1 signal axis leads to radiotherapy resistance of NPC and causes NPC cells to be in a fragile oxidative stress equilibrium. Meanwhile radioresistant cells are more sensitive to ferroptosis inducers. LINC01770 stabilizes TEAD1 by competitive binding with microRNA 615-5p and microRNA -1293. Radiation resistant cell is in a delicate balance of lipid peroxidation and more vulnerable to ferroptosis. In conclusion, our research suggest that LINC01770 serves as an independent prognostic factor in NPC. During the malignant progression of NPC caused by high expression of LINC01770, ferroptosis can be induced to effectively kill cancer cells and reverse RT resistance of NPC cells, providing evidence for the clinical application of ferroptosis in the treatment of recurrent and refractory NPC.",Homo sapiens,GSE236418,2024/07/01,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,"This dataset studies nasopharyngeal cancer and its radiation resistance, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

The latter relies on unique tissue-specific molecular programs induced by signals from the microenvironment and executed through a combinatorial action of tissue-specific and broadly expressed transcriptional regulators. Here, we identify the transcription factors Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as novel regulators of alveolar macrophages (AMs) – a population that provides the first line of immune defense and executes homeostatic functions in lung alveoli. In the absence of these factors, AMs exhibited decreased proliferation that resulted in a severe disadvantage of knockout AMs in a competitive setting. Gene expression analyses revealed a broad cell-intrinsic footprint of Bhlhe40/Bhlhe41-deficiency manifested by a downregulation of AM signature genes and induction of signature genes of other macrophage lineages. Genome-wide characterization of Bhlhe40 DNA binding suggested that these transcription factors directly repress the expression of lineage-inappropriate genes in AMs. Taken together, these results identify Bhlhe40 and Bhlhe41 as key regulators of AM self-renewal and guardians of their identity.",Mus musculus,GSE135018,2019/07/30,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,This dataset focuses on alveolar macrophages in mice and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

We sought to define a methylation signature to identify newly diagnosed individuals at high risk for developing metastasis. Methylation profiling was performed on 41 pUM with at least three years of follow-up using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (n=24) and the EPIC BeadChip (n= 17). Findings were validated in the TCGA cohort with known metastatic outcome (n=69). Differentially methylated probes were identified in patients who developed metastasis. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three epigenomic subtypes associated with metastasis. To identify a prognostic signature, recursive feature elimination and random forest models were utilized within repeated cross-validation iterations. The 250 most commonly selected probes compose the final signature, named MethylSig-UM. MethylSig-UM can distinguish individuals with pUM at diagnosis who developed future metastasis with an area under the curve of ~81% in the independent validation cohort, and remains significant in Cox proportional hazard models when combined with clinical features and established genomic biomarkers.

Here, we generated a single-cell RNA-sequencing (scRNA-seq) atlas of the murine nasal mucosa sampling three distinct regions before and during primary and secondary influenza A virus (IAV) infection. Primary infection was largely restricted to respiratory mucosa and induced stepwise changes in immune and epithelial cell type, subset, and state composition over time. Following viral clearance (14 dpi), rare, previously undescribed Krt13+ nasal immune-interacting floor epithelial (KNIIFE) cells expressing multiple genes with immune communication potential increased concurrently with tissue-resident memory T (TRM)-like cells and early IgG+/IgA+ plasmablasts. Proportionality analysis coupled with cell-cell communication inference, alongside validation by in situ microscopy, underscored the CXCL16–CXCR6 signaling axis between MDMs and effector CD8 T cells 8dpi and KNIIFE cells and TRM cells 14 dpi. Secondary influenza challenge with a homologous or heterologous strain administered 60 dpi induced an accelerated and coordinated myeloid and lymphoid response without epithelial proliferation, illustrating how tissue-scale memory to natural infection engages both myeloid and lymphoid cells to reduce epithelial regenerative burden.

403,200266145,Macrophage-mediated myelin-recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy (scRNA-Seq),"Tumors growing in metabolically-challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on cross-talk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. However, the intricacies of this metabolic interplay and the consequences on immune cell subset diversity and function remain largely unexplored. We interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single cell multi-omics analyses in preclinical glioblastoma mouse models and patient samples, and identified metabolically-rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations that fuel glioblastoma malignancy. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their increased lipid metabolism activity and cholesterol storage, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. In response to TME-derived cues triggering liver-X-receptor (LXR) expression, macrophages increase engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris and acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Furthermore, LLM content predicts clinical outcomes and immune checkpoint blockade response in glioblastoma patients and other cancer types.

While transcriptional regulation of the early stages of motor neuron specification is well-established, much less is known about the role of transcription factors in the later stages of maturation and terminal arborization. Defining the molecular mechanisms of these later stages is critical for elucidating how motor circuits are constructed. Here, we demonstrate that the transcription factor Nuclear Factor-IA (NFIA) is required for motor neuron positioning, axonal branching, and neuromuscular junction formation.

407,200244465,The Prostacyclin Receptor is a Nrf2-regulated Immune Checkpoint in CD8+ T cells,"Understanding how circulating metabolites enforce pathways in dysfunctional immune cells may illuminate modes of intervention directed at reviving immune function. The NRF2 pathway is the most widely documented cytoprotective axis in land-dwelling eukaryotes. However, the role of this pathway in CD8+ T cells—which seek and destroy tumors and pathogen infected cells—has yet to be elucidated. Our lab has conducted a RNAseq meta-analysis of CD8+ T cells upon tumor, viral and bacterial inoculation. Curiously, the NRF2 pathway was robustly upregulated in dysfunctional CD8+T cells. To further investigate the role of NRF2 in these contexts we developed a mouse model whereby the NRF2 axis is permanently hyperactivated in CD8+ T cells, hereafter referred to as NRF2Hi. Our in vivo data demonstrate that NRF2Hi CD8+ T cells offer little overall cytoprotection and poorly control tumors and pathogens versus wildtype (WT) control CD8+ T cells. To understand why upregulation of the NRF2 axis could be unfavorable to CD8+ T cell function we conducted RNAseq on NRF2Hi versus WT cells upon viral infection of mice. We found that NRF2Hi cells massively upregulate the prostacyclin receptor (PTGIR), which binds to prostacyclin—a circulating metabolite of arachidonic acid that has only been investigated in vasodilation and is seemingly benign to CD8+ T cells. To decipher the role of PTGIR in CD8+ T cells, we silenced its expression and observed a revival of CD8+ T cell function, significantly reducing tumor and pathogen burden.

408,200233484,Tumor cells impair immunological synapse formation via central nervous system-enriched metabolite,"Tumors employ various strategies to evade immune surveillance. Central nervous system (CNS) has multiple features to restrain immune response，because cranial inflammation can rapidly develop into lethal brain edema. However, whether tumors and CNS share similar programs of immune tolerance is elusive. Here, we analyzed transcriptomic and metabolomic profiles of tumors from patients with HER2+ breast cancer, who received trastuzumab, anti-PD-L1 antibodies and docetaxel (KN035-TH-HER2 study). We found that a neuronal metabolite N-acetylaspartate (NAA) and its synthetase N-acetyltransferase 8-like (NAT8L) are enriched in resistant tumors. In CNS, NAA is released during brain inflammation. We showed that NAT8L attenuates brain inflammation in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and impairs anti-tumor immunity by inhibiting cytotoxicity of NK cells and CD8+ T cells via NAA. Mechanistically, NAA disrupts the formation of immunological synapse by inducing K542 acetylation of lamin A, which inhibits the integration between lamin A and SUN2 and consequently impairs polarization of lytic granules in NK cells and CD8+ T cells.

410,200250238,JAK inhibitor overcomes resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in gastric cancer peritoneal dissemination in mouse,"Objective Cancer immunotherapy aims to unleash the immune system's potential against cancer cells, providing sustained relief for tumors responsive to immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). While promising in gastric cancer (GC) trials, the efficacy of ICIs diminishes in the context of peritoneal dissemination. Our objective is to identify strategies to enhance the impact of ICI treatment specifically for cases involving peritoneal dissemination in GC. Design The therapeutic efficacy of anti-PD1, CTLA4 treatment alone, or in combination, was assessed using the YTN16 peritoneal dissemination tumor model mice. Peritoneum and peritoneal exudate cells were collected for subsequent analysis. Immunohistochemical staining, flow cytometry, and bulk RNA-sequence analyses were conducted to evaluate the tumor microenvironment (TME). A JAK inhibitor (JAKi) was introduced based on the pathway analysis results. Results Anti-PD1 and anti-CTLA4 combination treatment (dual ICI treatment) demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in certain mice, primarily mediated by CD8+ T cells. However, in mice resistant to dual ICI treatment, even with CD8+ T cell infiltration, most of the T cells exhibited exhaustion phenotype. Notably, resistant tumors displayed abnormal activation of the JAK-STAT pathway compared to the untreated group, with observed infiltration of macrophages, neutrophils, and Tregs in the TME. The concurrent administration of JAKi rescued CD8+ T cells function and reshaped the immunosuppressive TME, resulting in enhanced efficacy of the dual ICI treatment. Conclusion Dual ICI treatment exerts its anti-tumor effects by increasing tumor- specific CD8+ T cell infiltration, and the addition of JAKi further improves ICI resistant by reshaping the immunosuppressive TME.",Mus musculus,GSE250238,2024/05/28,6.7,8.0,6.0,6.0,"This dataset examines the efficacy of JAK inhibitors in enhancing immune checkpoint inhibitor treatment in gastric cancer, which is relevant to understanding immunotherapy resistance.

411,200240584,Baf155 establishes chromatin priming to promote hematopoietic regeneration and function [bulk ATAC],"Chromatin priming promotes cell type-specific gene expression, lineage differentiation, and development. The mechanism of chromatin priming has not been well understood. Mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) lacking the Baf155 subunit of the BAF (BRG1/BRM associated factor) chromatin-remodeler produced a significantly reduced number of mature blood cells, leading to a failure of hematopoietic regeneration upon transplantation and 5-FU injury. Baf155 deficient HSPCs, while showing impaired mature blood cell production, generated a higher frequency of myeloid cells with fewer B and CD8+ T cells at homeostasis, supporting a more immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and enhanced tumor growth. Single-nuclei multi-omic analysis revealed that Baf155 deficient HSPCs failed to establish accessible chromatin and levels of lineage-specific transcripts were considerably lower. Regions that showed a substantial loss in chromatin accessibility were enriched for enhancers and binding motifs for hematopoietic lineage-specific transcription factors. Our study provides a fundamental mechanistic understanding of the role of Baf155 in establishing chromatin priming with functional consequences in regeneration or tumor immunity.",Mus musculus,GSE240584,2024/07/09,3.3,4.0,3.0,3.0,"This dataset investigates chromatin priming in hematopoietic stem cells, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

413,200267476,Oral squamous cell carcinomas drive monocytes into immunosuppressive CD25+CD163+CD206+ macrophages,"Tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) are major cellular components in the tumor microenvironment of oral squamous cell carcinomas (OSCCs). Most of these TAMs derive from circulating monocytes that differentiate in situ. In this work, we show that cell culture media (CM) derived from two OSCC cell lines, H413 and TR146, promote monocyte differentiation into M2 macrophages, characterized by a high expression of CD163, CD206 and a low expression of CD11c, CD86 and HLA-DR. These monocyte-derived macrophages (moMΦ) differentiated by CM from H413 cells were unable to activate allogeneic T cells, and inhibited T cell activation and proliferation induced by CD3/CD28 stimulation. By culturing monocytes with fractionated H413-CM, we found that soluble proteins mediated CD163+CD206+ moMΦ differentiation, discarding a role for small metabolites and extracellular vesicles. Differential proteomic analyses on H413-CM fractions revealed the presence of several proteins, including the complement factor H or plasminogen activator inhibitor, as potential candidates to induce CD163+CD206+ moMΦ differentiation. Finally, RNAseq transcriptomic analyses of H413 CM conditioned moMΦ, identified a signature expression profile involving cytokines and cytokine receptors, which surprisingly included IL2RA (CD25). CD25 enhanced expression was confirmed on H143-CM moMΦ. Collectively, these data indicate that the CM from OSCC cell lines promotes the differentiation of monocytes into functionally immunosuppressive macrophages and overall, our work contributes to the understanding of how OSCCs create an immunosuppressive cellular environment that favors tumor growth.",Homo sapiens,GSE267476,2024/07/03,2.3,3.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset focuses on oral squamous cell carcinomas and their immunosuppressive effects.

However, the impact of HRD and related therapies on the tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Our study generates single-cell gene expression and T-cell receptor profiles, along with validatory multimodal datasets from > 100 high-grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC) samples, primarily from a phase II clinical trial (NCT04507841). Neoadjuvant monotherapy with the PARP inhibitor niraparib achieves impressive 62.5% and 73.6% response rates per RECIST v1.1 and GCIG CA125, respectively. We identify effector regulatory T cells (eTreg) as key responders to HRD and neoadjuvant therapies, co-occurring with other tumor-reactive T cells, particularly terminally exhausted CD8+ T cells (Tex). TME-wide interferon signaling correlates with cancer cells upregulating MHC-II and co-inhibitory ligands, potentially driving Treg and Tex fates.

EV-miRnome was profiled on 174/245 patients by microarray platform and selected EV-miRs were validated by qPCR. A prognostic model combining EV-miR and clinical variables was built using stepwise Cox regression analysis and tested on an independent patient cohort (71/245). EV-PD-L1 gene copy number was assessed by digital PCR. For 54 patients with disease control, EV-miR changes at best response versus baseline were investigated by microarray and validated by qPCR. EV-miRNome profiling at baseline identified two EV-miR (miR-181a-5p, miR-574-5p) that, combined with performance status, are capable of discriminating patients unlikely from those that are likely to benefit from immunotherapy (median overall survival of 4 months or higher than 9 months, respectively).

416,200242030,CRISPR-Cas screen in ILC2 identifies Mef2d as a regulator of GATA3 and type-2 immunity [ChIP-Seq],"Group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) orchestrate tissue homeostasis, allergic disorders and anti-helminth protective immunity through their production of cytokines. However, their rarity has hampered high-throughput genetic screening approaches to uncover novel ILC2 regulators in an unbiased manner. We combined expansion of progenitors from multi-reporter mouse strains with optimised ILC differentiation cultures to perform CRISPR-Cas9 screens for regulators of ILC2 development and function. Mef2d emerged as a critical regulator of GATA3 and IL-13, and was essential for type-2 immunity as demonstrated by conditional Mef2d-deficient mice, including a Boolean-ILC2-Cre (BIC) mouse strain developed to enable ILC2-specific gene deletion. Mechanistically, Mef2d bound and transcriptionally repressed the Zc3h12a locus encoding the endonuclease Regnase-1, a negative regulator of IL-33 receptor (ST2) and GATA3 expression, thereby promoting IL-33-mediated ILC2 proliferation and cytokine production. Notably, in ILC2s Mef2d also acted downstream of leukotriene C4-induced calcium-mediated signalling to translocate NFAT1 to the nucleus to promote type-2 gene transcription.

419,200245246,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3994_ATAC],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245246,2024/07/01,3.3,4.0,4.0,2.0,"This dataset investigates ferroptosis and its regulation, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

420,200262796,Gene expression changes associated with acquired resistance to anti-EGFR therapy (cetuximab) in colorectal cancer cells,"Despite the implementation of personalized medicine, patients with metastatic CRC (mCRC) still have a dismal overall survival due to the frequent occurrence of acquired resistance mechanisms thereby leading to clinical relapse. Understanding molecular mechanisms that support acquired resistance to anti-EGFR targeted therapy in mCRC is therefore clinically relevant and key to improving patient outcomes. Here, we observe distinct metabolic changes between cetuximab-resistant CRC cell populations, with in particular an increased glycolytic activity in KRAS-mutant cetuximab-resistant LIM1215 but not in KRAS-amplified resistant DiFi cells. We show that cetuximab-resistant LIM1215 cells have the capacity to recycle glycolysis-derived lactate to sustain their growth capacity. This is associated with an upregulation of the lactate importer MCT1 at both transcript and protein levels. Pharmacological inhibition of MCT1, with AR-C155858, reduces the uptake and oxidation of lactate and impairs growth capacity in cetuximab-resistant LIM1215 cells.

While the ablation of Vista can alter the proportion of naïve CD4+ T cells with unique transcriptional signatures and the ‘readiness’ of the mice to break tolerance, the effect of non-heritable environmental exposures to commensals or infections remains entirely unknown. This is especially significant since individual variance in immune response, rather than being genetically inherited, is mostly attributed to environmental factors. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional heterogeneity characterizes even the germ-free (GF) mouse naïve CD4+ T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cell transcriptional subsets and their proportions were identical between GF, SPF and conventionalized GF mice, thus commensal-independent. Notwithstanding, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N.b.) infection altered the proportions of these transcriptional subsets, and the appearance of cells with a unique transcriptional signature. These naïve T cell-intrinsic changes accounted for the decreased immunization response of mice to an unrelated antigen. The compositional and functional changes in the naïve CD4+ T cell pool were dependent-variables of helminth infection, regressing with N.b. clearance.

We aimed to identify circulating microRNAs (miRNAs) with differential expression that could be potential biomarkers for the diagnosis and/or prognosis in Cushing's syndrome. In this data set, we analized thirty-six women in sustained remission for 13 ± 7 years (mean ± SD) from Cushing's syndrome, with a median age (IQ range) of 51 (45.2–60) years and mean ± SD BMI of 27 ± 4 Kg/m2, and 36 matched healthy controls using small RNA-sequencing of small RNA purified from plasma samples of these patients and control.

Here, we asked whether this mechanism is conserved across different types of carcinomas.

428,200250346,Image-based spatial transcriptomics identifies molecular niche dysregulation associated with distal lung remodeling in pulmonary fibrosis,"Pulmonary fibrosis (PF) is a chronic, progressive condition that represents the end-stage of many interstitial lung diseases (ILDs). Single-cell transcriptomic studies have revealed disease-emergent epithelial, fibroblast, and macrophage cell types/states in PF lungs, but the spatial contexts wherein these cells contribute to disease pathogenesis has remained uncertain. Using image-based spatial transcriptomics to profile gene expression changes in-situ across 28 lung samples from control and PF lungs, we characterized the expression of 343 genes in over 1 million nuclei at subcellular resolution. Using both cell-based and cell-agnostic approaches, we observed a diversity of distinct molecularly-defined spatial niches in control and PF lungs. Overlaying these computationally-defined niches with disease-associated histopathologic features, we identified novel patterns of dysregulation in alveoli informed by spatial context. We computationally segmented individual air spaces and using cell composition, we ordered airspaces from homeostatic to most dysregulated. Using this ordering we identified a series of stepwise molecular changes associated with progressive distal lung remodeling.

432,200269925,Ultrasound-mediated blood–spinal cord barrier opening prolongs survival in an ALS mouse model,"Background: Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disease characterized by a progressive loss of motor neurons. The limited efficacy of recent therapies in clinical development may be linked to lack of drug penetration to the affected motor neurons due to the blood-brain barrier (BBB) and blood-spinal cord barrier (BSCB). Methods: In this work, the safety and efficacy of repeated short transient opening of the BSCB by low intensity pulsed ultrasound (US, sonication) was studied in females of an ALS mouse model (B6.Cg-Tg(SOD1*G93A)1Gur/J). The BSCB was disrupted using a 1 MHz ultrasound transducer coupled to the spinal cord, with and without injection of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1), a neurotrophic factor that has previously shown efficacy in ALS models. Findings: Results in healthy mouse models demonstrated that the BSCB can be safely disrupted and IGF1 concentrations significantly enhanced after a single session of transient BSCB disruption (176 ±32 µg/g vs. 0.16 ±0.008 µg/g, p<0.0001). Five repeated weekly US performed in female ALS mice demonstrated a survival advantage in mice treated with IGF1 and ultrasound (US+IGF1) compared to treatment with IGF1 alone (176 vs. 166 days, p=0.0038). Surprisingly, this survival advantage was also present in mice treated with ultrasound (US) alone vs untreated mice (178.5 vs. 166.5 days, p=0.0061). Analysis of glial cell immunoreactivity and microglial transcriptome showing reduced cell proliferation pathways, in addition to lymphocyte infiltration, suggested that the beneficial effect of US or US+IGF1 could act through immune cell modulation. Interpretation: These results show the first step towards a possible beneficial impact of transient BSCB opening for ALS therapy and suggest implication of immune cells.",Mus musculus,GSE269925,2024/07/15,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset explores ALS and the blood-spinal cord barrier, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Ensartinib shows superior efficacy to crizotinib in both systemic and intracranial disease and is prepared to be reviewed overseas. In future, more patients would benefit from it based on its efficacy. However, a high incidence of hepatotoxicity has been observed in clinic, which often demands dose reduction or discontinuation of the drug, hampering its overall efficacy. Hence, it is inevitably valuable to study the mechanism which would be benefit to overcome the ensartinib-induced hepatotoxicity. In addition, based on the toxicity model, it is well established to understand the process of drug-induced liver injury and hepatic function-related molecules. Our findings discovered the level and location of TXNIP in liver homeostasis regulatory, clarified the molecular mechanism for ensartinib-induced hepatotoxicity and identified rutin as a potential strategy for the first time.

435,200179410,NAT10-mediated β-hydroxybutyrylation  Rewires Genomic 3D Conformation and Replication Timing [Hi-C],"Spatiotemporal regulation of chromatin replication (replication timing, RT） in eukaryotes is critical to maintain the genomic integrity. Here we focused on epigenetic mechanisms in rewiring genomic 3D conformation and replication timing. The results show that the novel lysine β-hydroxybutyrylation (Kbhb) modifications accelerates chromatin replication without inducing replication defects. This effect was mediated by the NAT10, a novel b-hydroxybutyryl-transferase, through regulating the association of NAT10 and CTCF with chromatin. Depletion of NAT10 and NAT10-mediated Kbhb dramatically reduce chromatin-bound NAT10 and CTCF, resulting in reorganization of genomic 3D conformation with enhanced trans- and cis-interaction in Hi-C matrix, with elevated proportion of A compartments, and with reorganized TADs boundaries. Moreover, reorganization of genomic 3D conformation contributes to rewire replication timing. These results support models in which NAT10-mediated β-hydroxybutyrylation coordinates genomic 3D conformation reorganization with replication timing alteration, and emphatically address the concept that epigenetic mechanisms reconcile genomic 3D conformation with replication timing.",Homo sapiens,GSE179410,2024/07/04,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on chromatin replication and epigenetic mechanisms, which are not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

436,200166762,Umbilical Cord Blood-derived Exosomes from Very Preterm Infants with Bronchopulmonary Dysplasia Impaired Endothelial Angiogenesis: Roles of Exosomal MicroRNAs,"Premature infants have a high risk of bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), which is characterized by abnormal development of alveoli and pulmonary vessels. Exosomes and exosomal miRNAs (EXO-miRNAs) from bronchoalveolar lavage fluid are involved in the development of BPD and might serve as predictive biomarkers for BPD. However, the roles of exosomes and EXO-miRNAs from umbilical cord blood of BPD infants in regulating angiogenesis are yet to be elucidated. In this study, we showed that umbilical cord blood-derived exosomes from BPD infants impaired angiogenesis in vitro. Next generation sequencing of EXO-miRNAs from preterm infants without (NBPD group) or with BPD (BPD group) uncovered a total of 418 differentially expressed (DE) EXO-miRNAs. These DE EXO-miRNAs were primarily enriched in cellular function-associated pathways including the PI3K/Akt and angiogenesis- related signaling pathways. Among those EXO-miRNAs which are associated with PI3K/Akt and angiogenesis-related signaling pathways, BPD reduced expression of hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-185-5p exhibiting most significant reduction (14.3% and 23.1% of NBPD group, respectively); BPD increased hsa-miR-200a-3p expression by 2.64 folds of NBPD group. Furthermore, overexpression of hsa-miR-103a-3p and hsa-miR-185-5p in normal human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) significantly enhanced endothelial cell proliferation, tube formation and cell migration, whereas overexpressing hsa-miR-200a-3p inhibited these cellular responses.

437,200234378,Mediator Kinase Inhibition Impedes Transcriptional Plasticity and Prevents Resistance to Sustained MAPK-Targeted Therapy in KRAS-Mutant Cancers,"Acquired resistance remains a major challenge for therapies targeting oncogene activated pathways. KRAS, for example, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, yet strategies targeting its downstream signaling kinases have failed to produce durable treatment responses. Here, we developed multiple models of acquired resistance to second-generation MAPK inhibitors across KRAS-mutant pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers, then probed the long-term events enabling survival against this class of drugs. These studies revealed that resistance emerges secondary to large-scale transcriptional adaptations that are diverse and tumor-specific. Transcriptional reprogramming extends beyond the well-established early response, and instead represents a dynamic, evolved process that is refined to attain a stably resistant phenotype. Mechanistic and translational studies reveal that resistance to sustained MAPK inhibition is broadly susceptible to manipulation of the epigenetic machinery, and that Mediator kinase, in particular, can be co-targeted at a bottleneck point to prevent diverse, tumor-specific resistance programs.",Homo sapiens,GSE234378,2024/06/26,7.3,6.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset investigates resistance mechanisms in KRAS-mutant cancers, including lung cancer.

438,200271668,Phase 1 trial of durvalumab (anti-PD-L1) in combination with lenalidomide in relapsed/refractory cutaneous T cell lymphoma,"T cells in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma (CTCL) are functionally exhausted, expressing immune inhibitory molecules such as PD1 and PD-L1. Durvalumab selectively targets PD-L1 on exhausted T cells and distinct cells within the CTCL tumor microenvironment (TME) and may restore an anti-tumor immune response. The oral immunomodulator lenalidomide, which has shown activity in CTCL, may enhance immune checkpoint blockade by durvalumab. We initiated a phase 1/2 clinical trial of lenalidomide and durvalumab in patients with refractory/advanced CTCL (NCT03011814). Primary objectives were to assess safety and tolerability and identify the maximum tolerated dose/recommended phase 2 dose. Secondary and tertiary objectives were to investigate efficacy and the effects on the TME. Thirteen patients enrolled in sequential cohorts received fixed dose durvalumab and dose escalation of lenalidomide. Thirteen patients were evaluable for toxicities and 12 for response in phase 1. No serious adverse events (AEs) or dose-limiting toxicities (DLTs) were observed during cycles 1-3 (DLT evaluation period). The most frequent AEs were tumor flare, fatigue, neutropenia and leukopenia. Three patients developed grade 1/2 autoimmune thyroiditis that resolved with treatment. Median cycles of treatment were 11 (range, 3-42+). Median duration of response was 25.5 (range 8-36.5) months. Anti-PD-L1/lenalidomide showed clinical activity; there were 7 partial responses, 4 stable disease and 1 progressive disease. Adaptive and innate immune signatures potentially predictive of response seen in gene expression profiling of serial skin samples were downregulation of TNF-alpha signaling via NFκB, IFN-gamma, and PI3-AKT-mTOR signaling pathways in responders vs up-regulation of MYC targets and pro-inflammatory pathways in non-responders.

439,200270481,3D brain vascular niche model captures invasive behavior and gene signatures of glioblastoma,"Glioblastoma (GBM) is a highly lethal brain cancer with no effective treatments; understanding how GBM cells respond to tumor microenvironment remain challenging as conventional cell cultures lack cytoarchitecture while in vivo models present complexity all at once. Developing a culture system to bridge the gap is thus crucial. Here, we employed a multicellular approach using human glia and vascular cells to optimize a 3-dimensional (3D) brain vascular niche model that enabled not only long-term culture of patient derived GBM cells but also recapitulation of key features of GBM heterogeneity and gene reprogramming in accordance with invasion behaviors and vascular association. Remarkably, vascular contact of GBM cells induced genes concerning neuronal, synaptic, and glia interaction, as well as immune suppression. This gene signature also displayed regional enrichment particularly in leading edge and microvascular proliferation zones and predicted worse prognosis for GBM patients. Furthermore, gene variance analysis uncovered histone demethylation and xylosyltransfererase activity as the main themes for the top induced genes in vivo, signifying the importance of chromatin remodeling and posttranslational modification proteoglygan such as CSPG in GBM adaption. Finally, our model also demonstrated a capacity to maintain GBM quiescence state and a protective niche against chemotherapy. In summary, our 3D model recapitulated key features of GBM heterogeneity and unveiled a previously unappreciated influence of brain glia-vascular unit for transcriptional adaption for neural/synaptic interaction and immunosuppression. The brain vascular niche model may serve as an effective bridge between 2D cultures and in vivo models for GBM modeling and therapeutic development.",Homo sapiens,GSE270481,2024/07/18,3.0,5.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset explores glioblastoma in a 3D model, which is not directly related to lung cancer but may provide insights into tumor microenvironments relevant to cancer biology.

441,200266486,B cell directed CAR-T cell therapy results in activation of CD8+ cytotoxic CAR-negative bystander T cells in both non-human primates and patients (human),"There is growing appreciation for the emergence of CARneg bystander T cells after CAR-T cell infusion. However, their phenotypic and transcriptomic hallmarks and mechanisms of activation remain uncertain. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on non-human primate (NHP) and patient-derived T cells to interrogate CARneg T cells following B cell targeted CAR-T cell therapy. In a NHP model, we observed a distinct population of activated CD8+ CARneg T cells emerging during CAR-T cell expansion. These bystander CD8+ CARneg T cells exhibited a unique transcriptional signature with upregulation of NK-cell markers (KIR3DL2, CD160, KLRD1), chemokines and chemokine receptors (CCL5, XCL1, CCR9), and downregulation of naive T cell-associated genes (SELL, CD28). A transcriptionally similar population was identified in patients following Tisangelecleucel infusion. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-2 and IL-15 exposure induced bystander-like CD8+ T cells.

443,200241978,IFN -induced Immunosuppression in Lung Carcinoma is Mediated by an Environmental Chemical Receptor (AhR) through PD-L1 and IDO Control (cm167 bulk RNA),"While immunotherapy has shown efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, many respond only partially or not at all. One limitation in improving outcomes is the lack of a complete understanding of factors regulating immune checkpoint targets. Here, we sought to address a possible link between an environmental chemical receptor implicated in NSCLC and immune regulation, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and a known but counterintuitive mediator of immunosuppression, IFN , in regulation of two immune checkpoints, PD-L1 and the IDO1, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). To this end we used AhR, PD-L1, and IFN R gene-edited LUAD cell lines, a syngeneic LUAD mouse model, bulk- and single cell-RNA sequencing of LUADs and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, and existing human transcriptomic databases. The data demonstrate that: 1) the AhR regulates both PD-L1 and IDO1 in murine and human LUAD cells, 2) AhR-driven IDO1 results in production of Kyn which likely mediates an AhR→IDO1→Kyn→AhR amplification loop, 3) the previously characterized induction by IFN of PD-L1 and IDO is mediated by the AhR, 4) transplantation of LUAD cells in which the AhR is deleted results in long-term tumor immunity in approximately half of the mice; slow growing tumors in the other half exhibit significantly higher densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing immunocompetence markers, and 5) deletion of either IFN R1 or PD-L1 does not provide the same level of immune protection as AhR deletion.

444,200233098,STAT3 inhibition permits epigenetic reprogramming and TLR9/IRF8-driven differentiation of inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia [scRNA-seq],"Cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells but achieving leukemic cell immunogenicity proved challenging in clinical setting. Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b.

445,200272311,Hyperglycemia-independent neonatal streptozotocin-induced retinopathy (NSIR) in rats,"Chemicals, such as MNU (N-methyl-N-nitrosourea) and NaIO3 (sodium iodate), are widely used to induce retinal degeneration in rodents. Streptozotocin (STZ) is an analog of N-acetyl glucosamine in which an MNU moiety is linked to a hexose and has a special toxic effect on insulin-producing pancreatic β-cells. It is commonly used to induce hyperglycemia to model diabetes. While intracerebroventricular injection of STZ can produce Alzheimer's disease independent of hyperglycemia, most retinal studies using STZ focus on the effects of hyperglycemia on the retina, but whether STZ has any impact on retinal cells independent of hyperglycemia is unknown. We aimed to investigate the role of cytotoxicity of STZ in rat retina. Intravitreal (5ug or 10ug) or subcutaneous (30mg/kg) injection of STZ at the early stage of newborn rats couldn’t induce hyperglycemia but caused NSIR (neonatal STZ-induced retinopathy), including reduced ERG amplitudes, retinal rosettes and apoptosis, cell cycle arrest, microglial activation, and delayed retinal angiogenesis. STZ did not affect the early-born retinal cell types but significantly reduced the late-born ones. Short-term and long-term hyperglycemia had no significant effects on the NSIR phenotypes. RNA sequencing revealed that STZ induces oxidative stress and activates the p53 pathway of retinal cells. Locally or systemically, STZ injection after P8 couldn’t induce NSIR when all retinal progenitors exit the cell cycle. Thus, NSIR in rats is independent of hyperglycemia but due to STZ’s direct cytotoxic effects on retinal progenitor cells. NSIR is a typical reaction to STZ-induced retinal oxidative stress and DNA damage. This significant finding suggests that NSIR may be a valuable model for studying retinal progenitor DNA damage-related diseases, potentially leading to new insights and treatments.",Rattus norvegicus,GSE272311,2024/07/16,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This dataset investigates retinopathy in rats and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

446,200245242,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3789_snRNA],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245242,2024/07/01,4.3,5.0,4.0,4.0,"This dataset identifies ferroptosis suppressors in cancer cells, which could have implications for cancer therapy.

447,200268196,IL-10 suppresses T cell expansion while promoting tissue-resident memory cell formation during SARS-CoV-2 infection in rhesus macaques,"SARS-CoV-2 infection leads to vastly divergent and heterogeneous clinical outcomes ranging from asymptomatic to fatal disease. Co-morbidities, sex, age, and host genetics together with vaccine status are known to affect disease severity. However, how the inflammatory milieu of the lung at the time of SARS-CoV-2 infection impacts control of the virus remains less well understood. Here, we identify key innate immune pathways required to limit viral replication, including the pro-inflammatory cytokine TNFα. Moreover, we demonstrate here that recent immune events in the lung proximal to the time of SARS-CoV-2 exposure can drastically impact viral control. A diverse set of pulmonary inflammatory stimuli, ranging from prior resolved respiratory infections of S. aureus or influenza, ongoing M. tuberculosis infection, or ovalbumin/alum-induced asthma to administration of defined TLR ligands and recombinant cytokines, resulted in an antiviral state that potently limited SARS-CoV-2 replication. In addition to type I interferons, the broadly inducible inflammatory cytokines TNFα and IL-1 very effectively conditioned the lung for enhanced viral control. Collectively, our work reveals that SARS-CoV-2 may benefit from an immunologically quiescent lung microenvironment and indicates that the recent and momentary pulmonary inflammatory tone during SARS-CoV-2 exposure may contribute to the population-wide variability in COVID-19 disease outcomes.",Macaca mulatta; Macaca fascicularis,GSE268196,2024/05/30,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset examines T cell responses during SARS-CoV-2 infection, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

448,200242052,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment [scATAC-seq],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE242052,2024/02/02,6.0,6.0,5.0,7.0,"This dataset explores T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment, which is relevant to immunotherapy.

Mitochondrial respiration is essential for survival and function of CAR-T cells, but developing strategies to specifically enhance mitochondrial respiration has been challenging. Here we identify MCJ/DnaJC15, an endogenous negative regulator of mitochondrial Complex I, as a metabolic target to enhance mitochondrial respiration in CD8 CAR-T cells. Loss of MCJ in CD8 CAR-T cells increases their in vitro and in vivo efficacy against mouse B cell leukemias. MCJ deficiency in TCR- specific CD8 cells also increases their efficacy against solid tumors in vivo.

452,200270904,Targeting Immune-Fibroblast Crosstalk in Myocardial Infarction and Cardiac Fibrosis V,"Inflammation and tissue fibrosis co-exist and are causally linked to organ dysfunction. However, the molecular mechanisms driving immune-fibroblast crosstalk in human cardiac disease remains unexplored, and there are currently no approved treatments that directly target cardiac fibrosis. Here, we performed multi-omic single-cell gene expression, epitope mapping, and chromatin accessibility profiling in 45 donors, acutely infarcted, and chronically failing human hearts. We identified a disease-associated fibroblast trajectory marked by cell surface expression of fibroblast activator protein (FAP), which diverged into distinct myofibroblasts and pro-fibrotic fibroblast populations, the latter resembling matrifibrocytes. We lineage traced FAP fibroblasts in vivo and showed that they contribute to the POSTN lineage but not the myofibroblast lineage. We assessed the applicability of experimental systems to model tissue fibrosis and demonstrated that 3 different in vivo mouse models of cardiac injury were superior compared to cultured human heart and dermal fibroblasts in recapitulating the human disease phenotype. Ligand-receptor analysis and spatial transcriptomics predicted that interactions between C-C chemokine receptor type 2 (CCR2) macrophages and fibroblasts mediated by interleukin 1 beta (IL-1β) signaling drove the emergence of pro-fibrotic fibroblasts within spatially defined niches. In vivo, we deleted the IL-1 receptor on fibroblasts, the IL-1β ligand in CCR2 monocytes and macrophages, and inhibited IL-1β signaling using a monoclonal antibody and showed fewer pro-fibrotic fibroblasts, decreased cardiac fibrosis, and improved cardiac function. Herein, we characterize fibroblast lineage diversification in the failing heart and showed a subset of macrophages signal to fibroblasts via IL-1β and rewire their gene regulatory network and differentiation trajectory towards a pro-fibrotic fibroblast phenotype.

456,200246743,MBNL1 regulates programmed postnatal switching between regenerative and differentiated cardiac states [ActD RNA-seq],"Background: Discovering determinants of cardiomyocyte maturity will be critical to understanding the maintenance of differentiated states and potentially reawakening endogenous regenerative programs in adult mammalian hearts as a therapeutic strategy. Recent evidence has suggested that forced dedifferentiation paired with oncogene expression is sufficient to drive cardiac regeneration. However, elucidation of endogenous developmental determinants of the switch between regenerative and mature cardiomyocyte cell states is necessary for optimal design of regenerative approaches for heart disease. Muscleblind-like 1 (MBNL1) regulates both fibroblast and erythroid differentiation and proliferation. Hence, we examined whether MBNL1 promotes and maintains mature cardiomyocyte states while antagonizing cardiomyocyte proliferation. Methods: MBNL1 gain- and loss-of-function mouse models were studied at several developmental timepoints and in surgical models of heart regeneration. Multi-omics approaches were combined with biochemical, histological, and in vitro genetic work to determine the mechanisms through which MBNL1 exerts its effects. Results: MBNL1 is co-expressed with a maturation-association genetic program in the heart and is regulated by the MEIS1/Calcineurin signaling axis. Targeted MBNL1 overexpression early in development prematurely transitioned cardiomyocytes to hypertrophic growth, hypoplasia, and dysfunction, while loss of MBNL1 function increased cardiomyocyte cell cycle entry and proliferation through altered cell cycle inhibitor transcript stability. Moreover, MBNL1-dependent stabilization of estrogen-related receptor signaling was essential for maintaining cardiomyocyte maturity in adult myocytes. In accordance with these data, modulating MBNL1 dose tuned the temporal window of neonatal cardiac regeneration, where increased MBNL1 expression arrested myocyte proliferation and regeneration, and MBNL1 deletion promoted regenerative states with prolonged myocyte proliferation. However, MBNL1 deletion was not sufficient to promote regeneration in the adult heart due to cell-cycle checkpoint activation. Conclusions: Here, MBNL1 was identified as an essential regulator of cardiomyocyte differentiated states, their developmental switch from hyperplastic to hypertrophic growth, and their regenerative potential through controlling an entire maturation program by stabilizing adult myocyte mRNAs during postnatal development and throughout adulthood. Additionally, MBNL1-dependent perturbations of a myocyte’s preferred growth mechanism at a given developmental state had detrimental consequences to cardiac function, and targeting loss of maturity and removing cell cycle inhibitors was not insufficient to promote adult regeneration.",Mus musculus,GSE246743,2024/03/07,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,This dataset focuses on cardiac states and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

In this study we explored the molecular mechanisms whereby a “synthetic immune niche” (SIN), composed of immobilized CCL21 and ICAM1, modulates the interplay between these two cellular properties. Temporal phenotypic profiling of OVA-specific murine T-cells revealed major differences in the response to the SIN stimulation following antigen-specific and non-specific activation. Thus, SIN treatment enhanced both the expansion and cytotoxicity of cells activated by OVA-loaded DCs, at day 4, while, similar treatment of cells activated by anti CD3/CD28-conjugated beads dramatically enhanced the cells’ expansion, but unexpectedly blocked their cytotoxicity, which fully recovered only on day 7.

459,200273053,The rRNA epitranscriptome and myonuclear SNORD landscape in skeletal muscle fibers contributes to ribosome heterogeneity and is altered by hypertrophic stimulus,"In cell biology, ribosomal RNA (rRNA) 2'O-methyl (2'-O-Me) is the most prevalent post-transcriptional chemical modification contributing to ribosome heterogeneity. The modification involves a family of small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and is specified by box C/D snoRNAs (SNORDs). Given the importance of ribosome biogenesis for skeletal muscle growth, we asked if rRNA 2'-O-Me in nascent ribosomes synthesized in response to a growth stimulus is an unrecognized mode of ribosome heterogeneity in muscle. To determine the pattern and dynamics of 2'-O-Me rRNA, we used a sequencing-based profiling method called RiboMeth-seq. We applied this method to tissue-derived rRNA of skeletal muscle and rRNA specifically from the muscle fiber using an inducible myofiber-specific RiboTag mouse in sedentary and mechanically overloaded conditions. These analyses were complemented by myonuclear-specific small RNA sequencing to profile SNORDs and link the rRNA epitranscriptome to known regulatory elements generated within the muscle fiber. We demonstrate for the first time that mechanical overload of skeletal muscle 1) induces decreased 2'-O-Me at a subset of skeletal muscle rRNAand 2) alters the SNORD profile in isolated myonuclei. These findings point to a transient diversification of the ribosome pool via 2'-O-Me during growth and adaptation in skeletal muscle.

463,200239440,In vivo multiplexed screen reveals a critical role of Keap1/Nrf2 pathway in small cell lung cancer [TUBAseq],"Approximately 15% of all lung cancer cases are small cell lung cancer (SCLC), which originates from neuroendocrine cells lining the airways (bronchi) of the lung. SCLC is known for its aggressive nature and swift growth, resulting in a five-year survival rate of around 6%. Understanding the genetic pathways that drive tumor development remains an ongoing challenge. In our study, we employed an in vivo multiplexed approach, known as Tuba-seq, to investigate the impact of the functional loss of 18 putative tumor suppressors. Our screening unveiled Pten and Keap1 as top candidates; knocking out either one promoted both tumor initiation and progression. We identified the Keap1/Cul3/Nrf2 pathway as a pivotal regulator for SCLC development, particularly in regulating the susceptibility of SCLC to ferroptosis. Our work not only established an in vivo multiplexed approach for assessing the role of tumor suppressors in SCLC but also uncovers a previously unappreciated role of Keap1 in SCLC.",Mus musculus,GSE239440,2024/01/26,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset is highly relevant as it investigates small cell lung cancer (SCLC), a subtype of lung cancer, and explores genetic pathways that drive tumor development.

465,200235122,DNA methylation signatures correlate with response to immune checkpoint inhibitors in metastatic melanoma,"DNA methylation profiles were recently proposed to have predictive value in various solid tumors. Therefore, we analyzed DNA methylation profiles of patients with stage IV metastatic melanoma, receiving first-line immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) and correlated those with radiological response (iRECIST). Overall, 81 tissue samples from 71 patients with metastatic melanoma (27 (38.0%) female, 44 (62.0%) male) were investigated; median progression free survival was 8.5 months (0 – 104.1 months) and median overall survival was 30.6 months (0 – 104.1 months), respectively. 29 (40.8%) patients achieved an objective response. DNA methylation analyses revealed signatures correlating with radiological response to ICIs. Based on the 500 mostly differentially methylated genes, three clusters were identified with the majority of responders being in cluster 1 (12/12) and cluster 2 (12/24), and non-responders in cluster 3 (39/45).

468,200234123,In Vivo Protein Turnover Rates in Varying Oxygen Tensions Nominate MYBBP1A as a Novel Mediator of the Hyperoxia Response,"Oxygen deprivation and excess are both toxic to mammals. Thus, the body’s ability to adapt to varying oxygen tensions is critical for survival. While the transcriptional response to acute hypoxia has been well-studied, the post-translational effects of hypoxia and hyperoxia have been underexplored. In this study, we systematically investigate protein turnover rates in mouse heart, lung, and brain under different inhaled oxygen tensions. We find that the lung proteome is the most responsive to changes in oxygen tension, likely due to the direct exposure of alveoli to inhaled oxygen. In particular, several extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins such as collagens and laminins, are stabilized in the lung under both hypoxia and hyperoxia, suggesting their post-translational regulation. Furthermore, we validate our previous finding that complex 1 of the electron transport chain (ETC) is destabilized in hyperoxia, explaining the exacerbation of associated disease models by hyperoxia and rescue by hypoxia. Moreover, we nominate MYBBP1A as a novel transcriptional regulator in hyperoxic lung, particularly in the context of rRNA homeostasis.

469,200234182,Lymphatic-localized Treg-mregDC crosstalk limits antigen trafficking and restrains anti-tumor immunity [scRNA-seq],"Tumor microenvironment (TME) plays critical roles in both tumor progression and immunotherapeutic efficacy. Here using single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq), we described the TME heterogeneity and found a specific state of CCL22+ dendritic cell (mregDC) cross talk close to regulatory T cells (Treg). We analyzed cell–cell communication mediated by ligand–receptor interactions and finally found that mregDCs probably attract Treg cells via chemotaxis and physically interact with them in tumor. Within this cross talk, Treg cells received activation signals from mregDCs and upregulated suppressive and adhesion molecules, including PD-1, ICOS, CTLA-4 and OX-40, further enhancing their interaction with mregDCs. In turn, the association of Treg cells with mregDCs restrained the trafficking of tumor antigen-bearing dendritic cells to draining mesenteric lymph nodes and thus dampened the presentation of tumor antigens to initiate anti-tumor immune responses in a cell contact dependent manner.",Mus musculus,GSE234182,2024/07/18,6.7,6.0,7.0,7.0,"This dataset investigates Treg and dendritic cell interactions in the tumor microenvironment, which is relevant to anti-tumor immunity.

470,200245936,NK receptors replace CD28 as the dominant source of signal 2 for cognate recognition of cancer cells by TAA-specific effector CD8+ T cells,"CD28-driven “signal 2” is critical for naïve CD8+ T cell responses to dendritic cell (DC)-presented weak antigens, including non-mutated tumor-associated antigens (TAAs). However, it is unclear how DC-primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) respond to the same TAAs presented by cancer cells which lack CD28 ligands. Here, we show that NK receptors (NKRs) DNAM-1 and NKG2D replace CD28 during CTL re-activation by cancer cells presenting low levels of MHC I/TAA complexes, leading to enhanced proximal TCR signaling, immune synapse formation, CTL polyfunctionality, release of cytolytic granules and antigen-specific cancer cell killing. Double-transduction of T cells with recombinant TCR and NKR constructs or upregulation of NKR-ligand expression on cancer cells by chemotherapy enabled effective recognition and killing of poorly immunogenic tumor cells by CTLs. Operational synergy between TCR and NKRs in CTL recognition explains the ability of cancer-expressed self-antigens to serve as tumor rejection antigens, helping to develop more effective therapies.",Homo sapiens,GSE245936,2024/07/19,8.0,7.0,9.0,8.0,"This dataset explores the role of NK receptors in T cell responses to cancer cells, which is highly relevant to immunotherapy.

471,200214584,Targeting advanced prostate cancer with STEAP1 chimeric antigen receptor T cell and tumor-localized IL-12 immunotherapy [scRNA-seq],"Six transmembrane epithelial antigen of the prostate 1 (STEAP1) is a compelling tumor-associated cell surface antigen for therapeutic targeting in solid tumors. Here, we identified broad expression of STEAP1 relative to the established theranostic target prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) in a series of lethal metastatic prostate cancers which prompted the development of a STEAP1-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy. STEAP1 CAR T cells demonstrated reactivity in low antigen density, antitumor activity across multiple metastatic human and mouse prostate cancer models, and preliminary safety in a human STEAP1 knock-in mouse model. In human-in-mouse and mouse-in-mouse studies, STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy yielded effective tumor responses, but antigen escape was appreciated as a recurrent mechanism of treatment resistance and STEAP1 antigen loss was associated with diminished tumor antigen processing and presentation. The application of tumor-localized interleukin-12 (IL-12) therapy in the form of a collagen binding domain (CBD)-IL-12 fusion protein as an adjunct to STEAP1 CAR T cell therapy enhanced antitumor efficacy by remodeling the immunologically cold tumor microenvironment of prostate cancer and combating STEAP1 antigen escape through the engagement of host immunity and epitope spreading.

472,200261186,Serial Changes of Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab,"Background and aims: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have promising outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, there is no reliable biomarker for predicting disease progression. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from peripheral blood have attracted attention in monitoring therapeutic efficacy. In this study, CTCs were serially collected from patients with HCC undergoing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo+Bev) treatment, and changes in molecular expression and CTC numbers were analyzed to identify effective biomarkers. Approach and results: The peripheral blood samples were collected serially from 22 patients with HCC treated with Atezo+Bev, and CTCs were enriched using RosetteSep. The CD45(-)PanCK(+) cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. RNA extracted from enriched CTCs underwent targeted RNA sequencing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. Changes in CTC numbers during Atezo+Bev treatment reflected the tumor volume. NGS analysis revealed that patients with elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling molecules had a poorer response, whereas those with elevated apoptosis signaling molecules had a favorable response (p < 0.05). In addition, compared with changes in CTC counts, changes in TGF-β signaling molecule expression in CTCs accurately and promptly predicted treatment response. Conclusions: NGS analysis of CTC-derived RNA showed that changes in TGF-β signaling molecules predict treatment response earlier than changes in CTC counts. These findings suggest that changes in the expression of TGF-β molecules in CTCs could serve as novel biomarkers for the early prediction of therapeutic response in patients with unresectable HCC undergoing Atezo+Bev therapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE261186,2024/07/17,4.3,5.0,5.0,3.0,"This dataset examines circulating tumor cells in hepatocellular carcinoma treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

473,200241235,A novel adjuvant formulation induces robust Th1/Th17 memory and mucosal recall responses in Non-Human Primates,"After clean drinking water, vaccination is the most impactful global health intervention. However, development of new vaccines against difficult-to-target diseases is hampered by the lack of diverse adjuvants for human use. Of particular interest, none of the currently available adjuvants induce Th17 cells. Here, we develop and test an improved liposomal adjuvant, termed CAF®10b, that incorporates a TLR-9 agonist. In a head-to-head study in non-human primates (NHPs), immunization with antigen adjuvanted with CAF®10b induced significantly increased antibody and cellular immune responses compared to previous CAF® adjuvants, already in clinical trials. This was not seen in the mouse model, demonstrating that adjuvant effects can be highly species specific. Importantly, intramuscular immunization of NHPs with CAF®10b induced robust Th17 responses that were observed in circulation half a year after vaccination. Furthermore, subsequent instillation of unadjuvanted antigen into the skin and lungs of these memory animals led to significant recall responses including transient local lung inflammation observed by Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT), elevated antibody titers, and expanded systemic and local Th1 and Th17 responses, including >20% antigen-specific T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage.

475,200242054,NR4a1/2 deletion promotes accumulation of TCF1+ stem-like precursors of exhausted CD8+ T cells in the tumor microenvironment [scRNA-seq_2],"Cytotoxic T cells (CTLs) play a crucial role in the elimination of cancer cells. However, within the intra-tumor microenvironment, these cells eventually undergo cell death or enter a state of dysfunction known as ""exhaustion"". T cell exhaustion not only impairs the efficacy of tumor immunity but also contributes to resistance against immune-checkpoint inhibitors. Our previous investigations have demonstrated that the NR4a family of nuclear receptors, induced by chronic TCR stimulation, plays a pivotal role in driving exhaustion. These receptors enhance the transcription of inhibitory molecules, such as PD1, while suppressing the expression of functional molecules, including cytokines. However, it remains unclear at which stage of T cell differentiation NR4a exerts its influence and whether the loss of NR4a can ""rejuvenate"" T cell fate. In the present study, we confirmed that simultaneous deletion of NR4a1 and NR4a2 in CD8+ T cells led to a less exhausted phenotype characterized by reduced expression of PD1, Tim3, and Tox, as well as increased oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS) and glycolysis activities, resulting in potent suppression of tumor growth. Interestingly, the transfer of activated NR4a1-/-NR4a2-/-CD8+ T cells into tumor-bearing mice gave rise to TCF1+ (Tcf7+) early memory T cells. Wild-type PD1+TIM3+CD8+ tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) diminished in the secondary transfer to tumor-bearing mice, while NR4a-deficient CD8+ TILs expanded even during the secondary transfer, indicating a strong stemness of memory T cells due to NR4a loss. We discovered that NR4a directly repressed the expression of Tcf7 by binding to the enhancer region of the Tcf7 gene. Collectively, these findings indicate that inhibiting NR4a in tumors represents a potent strategy for immuno-oncotherapy by enhancing stemness and reducing exhaustion of memory T cells.",Mus musculus,GSE242054,2024/02/02,7.7,7.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset investigates T cell exhaustion in the tumor microenvironment, which is highly relevant to immunotherapy.

We evaluated the nanoCARs in clinically relevant models in vitro, using co-cultures of CD70-specific nanoCAR T cells with malignant rhabdoid tumor organoids, and in vivo by using a diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) patient-derived xenograft (PDX) model. Whereas the nanoCAR T cells were highly efficient in organoid co-cultures, they showed only modest efficacy in the PDX model.

Using a point source, we delivered a spectrum of dose (~2-32 Gy) to the primary tumor and observed superior systemic immunity in models of metastatic cancer compared to low (2 Gy), moderate (8 Gy), or high (20 Gy) dose homogenous RT. Heterogeneity in RT dose resulted in spatial heterogeneity in gene expression and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, heterogenous RT optimally engaged multiple immune signaling pathways with diverse dose response relationships whereas responses to homogenous RT treatment groups were limited. Single cell RNAseq demonstrated unique enrichment of immune cell populations between each homogenous RT dose group, with several of these dose-dependent changes also represented in the heterogeneously treated tumors, with engagement of both lymphoid and myeloid compartments.

486,200232546,Exploring the Stability of Genomic Imprinting and X-Chromosome Inactivation in the Aged Brain (RNA-Seq),"DNA methylation is a common mechanism regulating monoallelic expression of different genes, including imprinted genes. How age-induced alterations of methylation levels vary across alleles and impact on monoallelic expression is unknown. In the brain, this phenomenon may contribute mechanistically to neuronal dysfunction and disease. In order to investigate the allele specific transcriptional and epigenetic signatures of aging, we used key brain areas, hippocampus and cerebellum, of juvenile and old hybrid mice obtained from BL6×CAST/EiJ (CAST) reciprocal crosses. We set out to explore whether epigenetic drift affects global DNA methylation machinery by investigating 5- methylcytosine (5-mC) and 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) levels. Mass spectrometry analysis showed a significant increase of 5hmC levels in hippocampus of old mice, but this was not accompanied by measurable differences in methylating and demethylating enzymes. The expression of several repetitive elements (LINEs, SINEs, IAP) was also analysed, strictly dependent on 5mC and 5hmC levels, and reporting a reduction of the intracisternal A-particle (IAP) retrotransposons in HCP of old mice. We uncovered the allelic-specific DNA methylation profile of aging using genomic imprinting as a read-out by IMPLICON and allelic expression by RNA sequencing. Here, imprinting is not substantially changed during aging, not affecting their normal monoallelic expression.

491,200268049,The effect of exposure to neighborhood violence on GR signaling in lung tumors [Spatial Transcriptomics],"Despite lower rates and intensity of smoking, Black men experience a higher incidence of lung cancer compared to White men. The racial disparity in lung cancer is particularly pronounced in Chicago, a highly segregated urban city. Neighborhood conditions, particularly social stress, may play a role in lung tumorigenesis. Preliminary studies indicate that Black men residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime have significantly higher levels of hair cortisol, an indicator of stress response. To examine the relationship between social stress exposure and gene expression in lung tumors, we investigated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in lung tumor samples in relation to GR target gene expression levels and zip code level residential neighborhood violence. Spatial transcriptomics and a version of ChIP-sequencing known as CUT & RUN were used. GR recruitment to chromatin was correlated with neighborhood violent crime rate and overall GR binding increased with increasing neighborhood violent crime rates. Among patients residing in high-violence neighborhoods, tumor samples, compared to normal neighboring lung tissue, had fewer GR binding sites. The opposite was seen in patients residing in low-violence neighborhoods, with tumor samples having more GR binding sites when compared to normal lung tissue. Tumor samples from patients living in high-violence neighborhoods exhibited increased GR recruitment to genes associated with greater tumor aggressiveness. Our findings suggest that exposure to neighborhood violence may influence tumor biology via reprogramming GR recruitment.

Here, we report that short-term exposure to mild cold temperature (STEMCT: 15°C for 24 hours) averted lethal hypothermia of mice lacking HDAC3 in BAT (HDAC3 BAT KO) exposed to 4°C. STEMCT restored the induction of the thermogenic coactivator PGC-1a along with UCP1 at 22°C, which is greatly impaired in HDAC3-deficient BAT, and deletion of either UCP1 or PGC-1a prevented the protective effect of STEMCT. Remarkably, the protection of HDAC3 BAT KO mice from cold intolerance following STEMCT lasted for up to 7 days. Transcriptional activator C/EBPb was induced by short-term cold exposure in mouse and human BAT and, uniquely, remained high for 7 days following STEMCT. Furthermore, analysis of C/EBPb activity revealed increased binding following STEMCT at genes, including the enhancers/promotors of UCP1 and PGC-1a.

496,200161648,Loss of Fas-signaling in pro-fibrotic fibroblasts impairs homeostatic fibrosis resolution and promotes persistent pulmonary fibrosis,"Idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) is a progressive, irreversible fibrotic disease of the distal lung alveoli that culminates in respiratory failure and reduced lifespan. Unlike normal lung repair in response to injury, IPF is associated with the accumulation and persistence of fibroblasts and myofibroblasts and continued production of collagen and other extracellular matrix (ECM) components. Prior in vitro studies have led to the hypothesis that the development of resistance to Fas-induced apoptosis by lung fibroblasts and myofibroblasts contibributes to their accumulation in the distal lung tissues of IPF patients. Here, we test this hypothesis in vivo in the resolving model of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in mice. Using genetic loss-of-function approaches to inhibit Fas signaling in fibroblasts, novel flow cytometry strategies to quantify lung fibroblast subsets and transcriptional profiling of lung fibroblasts by bulk and single cell RNA-sequencing, we show that Fas is necessary for lung fibroblast apoptosis during homeostatic resolution of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in vivo. Furthermore, we show that loss of Fas signaling leads to the persistence and continued pro-fibrotic functions of lung fibroblasts. Our studies provide novel insights into the mechanisms that contribute to fibroblast survival, persistence and continued ECM deposition in the context of IPF and how failure to undergo Fas-induced apoptosis prevents fibrosis resolution.",Mus musculus,GSE161648,2020/11/18,3.0,4.0,2.0,3.0,"This dataset examines the role of Fas signaling in pulmonary fibrosis, which is relevant to lung tissue.

Experimental studies have shown that gene expression in individual VLM neurons is predictive of their function. However, the molecular and cellular organization of the VLM has remained uncertain. This study aimed to create a comprehensive dataset of VLM cells using single-cell RNA sequencing in male and female mice. The dataset was enriched with targeted sequencing of spinally-projecting and adrenergic/noradrenergic VLM neurons. Based on differentially expressed genes, the resulting dataset of 114,805 VLM cells identifies 23 subtypes of neurons, excluding those in the inferior olive, and 5 subtypes of astrocytes. Spinally-projecting neurons were found to be abundant in 7 subtypes of neurons, which were validated through in-situ hybridization. These subtypes included adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons, serotonergic neurons, and neurons expressing gene markers associated with pre-motor neurons in the ventromedial medulla. Further analysis of adrenergic/noradrenergic neurons and serotonergic neurons identified 9 and 6 subtypes, respectively, within each class of monoaminergic neurons.

498,200234919,Single-cell transcriptomics of Marjolin ulcers,"Marjolin's ulcer is a a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy that can arise on previously injured skin, established scars, and chronic non-healing wounds. It is most often found in burn scars, but it can also occur in other types of wounds, including venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, and vaccination sites. The most common histological type of Marjolin’s ulcers is squamous cell carcinoma, however basal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and sarcomas have also been reported. All parts of the body could potentially be affected yet the lower extremities are the anatomic sites most commonly involved. While SCCs commonly have a metastasis rate of 0.5 to 3.0 percent, those arising from burn scars metastasize at a rate in excess of 30 percent. The 5-year survival after a diagnosis of Marjolin’s ulcer was found to be 50 percent. The transformation to a malignancy can occur either chronically, over a period of more than 35 years, or occasionally within a year of the original injury. The exact mechanism of this transformation is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to chronic keratinocyte dysfunction during the healing process of severe burn wounds. Surgical excision is the main treatment for Marjolin's ulcer and provides the best chance of survival. In a previous study, we investigated the bulk transcriptional changes that lead to Marjolin's ulcer by comparing global gene expression changes between squamous cells present in a squamous cell carcinoma versus those present within Marjolin's ulcer (MU) (Sinha et. al. JBCR 2017). This imparted novel insights into mechanisms underlying divergent clinical features of these cutaneous cancers. The goal of our current study is to characterize a new case of Marjolin's ulcer in a patient under our care by analyzing the cell types, their frequencies, and their individual transcriptional responses within a burn scar versus within Marjolin's ulcer.

500,200252085,"The osteocytic actions of glucocorticoids on bone mass, mechanical properties, or perilacunar remodeling outcomes are not rescued by PTH","Glucocorticoids (GC) and parathyroid hormone (PTH) are widely used therapeutic endocrine hormones where their effects on bone and joint arise from actions on multiple skeletal cell types. In osteocytes, GC and PTH exert opposing effects on perilacunar canalicular remodeling (PLR). Suppressed PLR can impair bone quality and joint homeostasis, including in GC-induced osteonecrosis. However, combined effects of GC and PTH on PLR are unknown. Focusing on subchondral bone and joint homeostasis, we hypothesize that PTH, a PLR agonist, could rescue GC-suppressed PLR. The skeletal effects of GC and PTH, alone or combined, were examined in male and female mice by micro-computed tomography, mechanical testing, histology, and gene expression analysis. For each outcome, females were more responsive to GC and PTH than males. GC and PTH exerted regional differences, with GC increasing trabecular bone volume but reducing cortical bone thickness, stiffness, and ultimate force. Despite PTH’s anabolic effects on trabecular bone, it did not rescue GC’s catabolic effects on cortical bone. Likewise, cartilage integrity and subchondral bone apoptosis, alkaline phosphatase activity, and osteocyte lacunocanalicular networks showed no evidence that PTH could offset GC-dependent effects. Rather, GC and PTH each increased cortical bone gene expression implicated in bone resorption by osteoclasts and osteocytes, including Acp5, Mmp13, Atp6v0d2, Ctsk, differences maintained when GC and PTH were combined. Since PTH is insufficient to rescue GC’s effects on young female mouse bone, future studies are needed to determine if osteocyte PLR suppression, due to GC, aging, or other factors, can be offset by a PLR agonist.",Mus musculus,GSE252085,2024/07/18,0.7,0.0,1.0,1.0,"The dataset focuses on glucocorticoids and parathyroid hormone effects on bone and joint health in mice, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",Homo sapiens,GSE245244,2024/07/01,5.7,6.0,5.0,6.0,"This dataset investigates ferroptosis in cancer cells and identifies SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors, with a specific focus on lung cancer cells.

502,200246335,Targeting the mevalonate or Wnt pathways to overcome CAR T-cell resistance in TP53-mutant AML cells,"TP53-mutant acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and myelodysplastic neoplasms (MDS) are characterized by chemotherapy resistance and represent an unmet clinical need. Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy might be a promising therapeutic option for TP53-mutant AML/MDS. However, the impact of TP53 deficiency in AML cells on the efficacy of CAR T-cells is unknown. We here show that CAR T-cells engaging TP53-deficient leukemia cells exhibit a prolonged interaction time, upregulate exhaustion markers, and are unable to control AML cell outgrowth in vitro and in vivo compared to TP53 wildtype cells. Transcriptional profiling revealed that the mevalonate pathway is upregulated in TP53-deficient AML cells under CAR T-cell attack, while CAR T-cells engaging TP53-deficient AML cells downregulate the Wnt pathway. In vitro rational targeting of either of these pathways rescues AML cell sensitivity to CAR T-cell-mediated killing. We thus demonstrate that TP53 deficiency confers resistance to CAR T-cell therapy and identify the mevalonate pathway as a therapeutic vulnerability of TP53-deficient AML cells engaged by CAR T-cells, and the Wnt pathway as a promising CAR T-cell therapy-enhancing approach for TP53-deficient AML/MDS.",Homo sapiens,GSE246335,2023/10/31,3.3,4.0,4.0,2.0,"This study examines CAR T-cell therapy in TP53-mutant acute myeloid leukemia, which is not lung cancer.

504,200263726,The N6-methyladenosine Epitranscriptomic Landscape in Lung Adenocarcinoma [RNA-seq],"N6-methyladenosine (m6A) modification plays a central role in both RNA and tumor biology. Yet comprehensive m6A epitranscriptome profiling of primary tumors remains uncharted. To fill this gap, we profiled the m6A epitranscriptome of 10 non-neoplastic lung (NL) tissues and 51 lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) tumors, integrating them with corresponding transcriptome, proteome and extensive clinical annotation. A total of 8,030 genes are marked with m6A modification, with variable abundances across tumors. Distinct clusters and genes were found to be linked exclusively to disease progression through m6A, rather than mRNA or protein levels. In comparison with NL tissues, 430 transcripts were hypo-methylated in tumors, and 222 were hyper-methylated. Fully 69% of these had no influence on RNA abundances. Amongst these genes, EML4 emerged as a novel metastatic driver, displaying significant hyper-methylation in tumors. m6A modification promoted EML4 translation and led to widespread EML4 overexpression in primary tumors. Functionally, EML4 modulated cytoskeleton dynamics and cell morphology, triggering cellular protrusions and enhancing cellular motility, local invasion, and metastasis. Clinically, high EML4 protein abundance correlated with features of metastasis. A METTL3 small molecule inhibitor markedly diminished both EML4 m6A and protein abundance, and efficiently suppressed lung metastases in vivo.

508,200270493,Effects of PP121/ bufalin-induced differentiation on gene expression of neuroblastoma SK-N-AS and GIMEN cells,"Tumor cell heterogeneity in neuroblastoma, a pediatric cancer arising from neural crest-derived progenitor cells, poses a significant clinical challenge. In particular, unlike adrenergic (ADRN) neuroblastoma cells, mesenchymal (MES) cells are resistant to chemotherapy and retinoid therapy and thereby significantly contribute to relapses and treatment failures. Previous research suggested that overexpression or activation of miR-124, a neurogenic microRNA with tumor suppressor activity, can induce the differentiation of retinoic acid-resistant neuroblastoma cells. Leveraging our established screen for miRNA modulatory small molecules, we validated PP121, a dual inhibitor of tyrosine and phosphoinositide kinases, as a robust inducer of miR-124. A combination of PP121 and miR-132-inducing bufalin synergistically arrests proliferation, induces differentiation, and prolongs the survival of differentiated MES SK-N-AS cells for 8 weeks. RNA-seq and deconvolution analyses revealed a collapse of the ADRN core regulatory circuitry (CRC) and the emergence of novel CRCs associated with chromaffin cells and Schwann cell precursors. Using a similar protocol, we differentiated and maintained other MES neuroblastoma, as well as glioblastoma cells, over 16 weeks. In conclusion, our novel protocol suggests a promising treatment for therapy-resistant cancers of the nervous system.

509,200272770,LSD1 inhibition improves efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy by enhancing CD8+ T cell responsiveness,"The lysine-specific histonedemethylase1A(LSD1) has been described to play a role in antitumor immunity; however, the role of LSD1 in shaping CD8+ T cell (CTL) differentiation and function is not understood. Here, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 (LSD1i) in CTL elicited phenotypic and functional alterations of the CTL that led to robust antitumor immunity in the context of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). In addition, the combination of anti-PDL1 therapy with LSD1i-based ACT resulted in a complete tumor eradication and long-lasting tumor-free survival. This study demonstrated that LSD1i together with anti-PDL1 therapy complement each other’s deficiencies and produce a better tumor response in a melanoma model, in which both immune and epigenetic therapy alone have shown limited efficacy.

To assess how human cells respond to defective mitochondrial respiration, we analyzed metabolomics profiles in cells with deficient electron transport chain (ETC). We found that ETC deficiency induces an accumulation of purine nucleotides. Additionally, we revealed that ETC blockade suppressed de novo purine nucleotide biosynthesis while enhanced purine salvage. This metabolic rewiring of purine nucleotide biosynthesis is not regulated at the transcriptional level. Instead, stable isotope tracing experiments showed that ETC blockade promoted the oxidative branch of pentose phosphate pathway to elevate phosphoribosyl diphosphate to drive purine salvage. In summary, our findings delineate how cells remodel purine metabolism in response to ETC blockade, and uncover a new metabolic vulnerability in tumors with low respiration.",Homo sapiens,GSE265923,2024/05/09,1.3,1.0,2.0,1.0,The dataset investigates metabolic responses in human cancer cells but does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

511,200180096,Ethylene Responsive Factor 34 (ERF34) negatively mediates salt stress-induced leaf senescence by regulating the expression of salt stress-responsive genes in Arabidopsis,"Leaf senescence, the last step of leaf development which is important for plant’s fitness, proceeds with age but is modulated by various environmental stresses and hormones. Salt stress is one of the well-known environmental stresses that accelerate leaf senescence. However, the molecular mechanisms how the signal of salt stress is integrated into leaf senescence programs are still elusive. In this study, we characterized the function of an Arabidopsis APETALA 2/ETHYLENE RESPONSIVE FACTOR (AP2/ERF) family transcription factor, ERF34, in salt stress-induced leaf senescence. ERF34 was differentially expressed under leaf senescence-inducing conditions including age, dark, and high salt. ERF34 negatively regulated salt stress-induced leaf senescence as well as promoted salt stress tolerance at diverse developmental stages. Analysis of genome-wide targets of ERF34 revealed that the overexpression of ERF34 could alter salt-responsive gene expression. Moreover, ERF34 directly bound to the promoters of EARLY RESPONSIVE TO DEHYDRATION 10 and RESPONSE TO DESICCATION 29A and activated their expression.

In this study, we found that persistent activation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-signaling in airway-derived, repair-associated cell types/states is a hallmark of dysfunctional epithelial repair in the IPF lung epithelium and experimental models of recurrent lung epithelial injury. Disrupting Hif-signaling attenuated experimental lung fibrosis, reduced mucous-secretory cell polarization, and promoted functional alveolar regeneration following repetitive injury. Mouse and human organoid studies demonstrated that small-molecule-based HIF2 inhibition promoted alveolar epithelial cell proliferation and maturation while preventing the emergence of maladaptive intermediate/transitional states analogous to those in IPF. Together, these studies indicate that targeted HIF2-inhibition represents a novel and effective therapeutic strategy to promote functional lung regeneration, and could be readily translated into human studies of IPF and other chronic interstitial lung diseases with disease modifying effect.",Homo sapiens; Mus musculus,GSE243252,2023/09/18,4.7,5.0,5.0,4.0,"This study explores HIF2's role in lung regeneration and fibrosis, which may have implications for lung cancer therapy.

513,200235704,A SWI/SNF-dependent transcriptional regulation mediated by POU2AF2/C11orf53 at enhancer,"Recent studies have identified a previously uncharacterized protein C11orf53 (now named POU2AF2/OCA-T1), functions as a new co-activator of POU2F3, the master transcription factor which is critical for both normal and neoplastic tuft cell identity and viability. Here, we demonstrated that POU2AF2 functions as an “Yin-Yang” factor which mediates both transcriptional activation and repression at distal enhance elements. Loss of POU2AF2 led to an inhibition of active enhancer nearby genes, such as tuft cell identity genes, and a derepression of Polycomb-dependent poised enhancer nearby genes, which are critical for cell viability and differentiation. Mechanistically, depletion of POU2AF2 leads to a global redistribution of the chromatin occupancy of SWI/SNF complex, resulting in a significant 3D genome structure change and a subsequent transcriptional reprogramming. Genome wide CRISPR screen further demonstrated that POU2AF2 depletion or SWI/SNF inhibition led to a PTEN-dependent cell growth defect, which revealed a potential role of POU2AF2-SWI/SNF axis in small cell lung cancer pathogenesis. Finally, pharmacological inhibition of SWI/SNF phenocopied POU2AF2 depletion in terms of gene expression alteration and cell viability decease in SCLC-P subtype cells. Therefore, impeding POU2AF2 mediated SWI/SNF function represents a potential therapeutic approach for human SCLC therapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE235704,2024/01/19,6.5,7.0,6.0,,"This dataset investigates POU2AF2's role in small cell lung cancer, linking transcriptional regulation to lung cancer pathogenesis.

514,200270741,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [WM35],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE270741,2024/07/24,6.5,6.0,7.0,,"The study examines ceramide metabolism in melanoma and its implications for immune checkpoint inhibitors.

515,200245804,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [Hi-C],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments.

516,200255334,Epigenetic imprinting of H3K4me3 in adipose-derived stem cells by HFS diet consumption leads to a disturbed transcriptomic profile in adipocytes [RNA-seq],"Adipose tissue metabolism is actively involved in the regulation of energy balance. Adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) play a critical role in maintaining adipose tissue function through their differentiation into mature adipocytes. The aim of this study was to investigate the effect of an obesogenic environment on the epigenetic landscape of ASCs and its impact on adipocyte differentiation and its metabolic consequences. Our results showed that ASCs from mice fed a high-fat sucrose (HFS) diet exhibited reduced adipogenic capacity, increased fat accumulation, and formed larger adipocytes than those from the control group (C). The results showed that ASCs from mice fed the HFS diet had reduced adipogenic capacity. Mitochondrial analysis showed increased mitochondrial activity in undifferentiated ASC-HFS, but decreased respiratory and glycolytic capacity in mature adipocytes. The HFS diet significantly altered the H3K4me3 acetylation profile of ASCs in genes related to adipogenesis, mitochondrial function, inflammatory response and immunomodulation. After differentiation, adipocytes retained H3K4me3 alterations in genes related to inflammatory response and immunomodulation. RNA-seq confirmed the upregulation of genes associated with inflammatory and immunomodulatory pathways in adipocytes. This study demonstrates that HFS diet induces profound epigenetic and transcriptomic changes in ASCs, leading to impaired differentiation and dysfunctional adipocyte formation.",Rattus norvegicus,GSE255334,2024/06/06,1.0,1.0,1.0,,"The study focuses on adipose-derived stem cells and their epigenetic changes, which are unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Sitting at the interface of the gut microbiome and mucosal immunity, adaptive and innate lymphoid populations regulate the balance between commensal micro-organisms and pathogens. Checkpoint inhibitors (CPI), particularly those targeting the CTLA-4 pathway, disrupt this fine balance and can lead to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and immune checkpoint colitis (CPI-C). Here, we show that CTLA-4 is expressed by innate lymphoid cells (ILC) and that its expression is regulated by ILC subset-specific cytokine cues in a microbiota-dependent manner. Genetic deletion or antibody blockade of CTLA-4 demonstrates that this pathway plays a key role in intestinal homeostasis and is conserved in human IBD and CPI-induced colitis (CPI-C). We propose that this population of CTLA-4-positive ILC may serve as an important target for the treatment of idiopathic and iatrogenic intestinal inflammation.",Mus musculus,GSE254247,2024/04/05,5.5,6.0,5.0,,"This dataset investigates CTLA-4's role in the innate immune system, which is relevant to immunotherapy.

The mechanism of chromatin priming has not been well understood. Mouse hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPCs) lacking the Baf155 subunit of the BAF (BRG1/BRM associated factor) chromatin-remodeler produced a significantly reduced number of mature blood cells, leading to a failure of hematopoietic regeneration upon transplantation and 5-FU injury. Baf155 deficient HSPCs, while showing impaired mature blood cell production, generated a higher frequency of myeloid cells with fewer B and CD8+ T cells at homeostasis, supporting a more immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment and enhanced tumor growth. Single-nuclei multi-omic analysis revealed that Baf155 deficient HSPCs failed to establish accessible chromatin and levels of lineage-specific transcripts were considerably lower.

520,200271409,Endoglin regulates the integrity of the bone marrow vasculature,"Patients with a heterozygous mutation in Endoglin (Eng) suffer from hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT), a condition characterized by the development of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) across various organs, leading to significant bleeding, blood abnormalities, and anemia. Eng is a transmembrane protein and an accessory receptor for transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) and is therefore essential for maintaining normal vascular architecture. Despite extensive research linking Eng deficiency to AVMs, the precise mechanisms driving this association remain poorly understood. In addition, the role of the bone marrow, a primary source of immune and other blood cells, in the context of endothelial Eng (EC-Eng) deficiency has yet to be explored. In this study, we demonstrate that bone marrow blood vessels conditionally deficient in Eng undergo a temporally orchestrated remodeling process over four weeks, characterized by distinct proliferative and resolution phases. We detail the specific phases of this remodeling, including angiogenic set points, the involvement of the beta integrin family, and modulation of vascular integrity. Furthermore, we explore the impact on the hematopoietic stem and progenitor cell (HSPC) compartment and the resultant changes in circulating blood cells. Using a conditional heterozygous deficient EC-Eng mouse model, we observe significant similarities to phenotypes described in the cKO line, which may ultimately be detrimental in patients with HHT. Taken together, using a combination of different in vivo approaches, our research proposes that very low levels of Eng expression in the endothelium may drive critical vascular remodeling in the bone marrow, sharing mechanisms with early vascular processes leading to AVM formation.",Mus musculus,GSE271409,2024/07/25,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on Endoglin and its role in vascular integrity and is primarily related to hereditary hemorrhagic telangiectasia.

521,200272045,Identification of mutant KRAS-related genes associated with malignant phenotypes in NSCLC,"Oncogenic KRAS is found in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we conducted microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that although the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is significantly downregulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho–epidermal growth factor receptor, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment, but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs.

As the global population ages and comorbidities increase, there is a heightened concern about this infection. We investigated the immunological responses of older adults to pneumococcal controlled human infection by analysing the cellular composition and gene expression in the nasal mucosa. Our comparative analysis with data from a concurrent study in younger adults revealed distinct gene expression patterns in older individuals susceptible to colonization, highlighted by neutrophil activation and elevated levels of CXCL9 and CXCL10. Unlike younger adults challenged with pneumococcus, older adults did not show recruitment of monocytes into the nasal mucosa following nasal colonization. However, older adults who were protected from colonization showed increased degranulation of CD8+ T cells, both before and after pneumococcal challenge. These findings suggest age-associated cellular changes, in particular enhanced mucosal inflammation, that may predispose older adults to pneumococcal colonization.",Homo sapiens,GSE261277,2024/07/12,2.0,2.0,2.0,2.0,"This dataset studies the immunological responses to pneumococcal infection in older adults, which is somewhat related to immune responses but does not focus on lung cancer or immunotherapy.

523,200234159,Radiation dose heterogeneity primes response to immune checkpoint blockade to generate anti-tumor immunity [scRNA-Seq],"The immunologic effects of radiation (RT) are influenced by dose and each may be optimized over a unique dose range. We hypothesized that delivering a heterogenous dose of RT would enhance anti-tumor immunity compared to homogenous RT in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICI). Using a point source, we delivered a spectrum of dose (~2-32 Gy) to the primary tumor and observed superior systemic immunity in models of metastatic cancer compared to low (2 Gy), moderate (8 Gy), or high (20 Gy) dose homogenous RT. Heterogeneity in RT dose resulted in spatial heterogeneity in gene expression and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, heterogenous RT optimally engaged multiple immune signaling pathways with diverse dose response relationships whereas responses to homogenous RT treatment groups were limited. Single cell RNAseq demonstrated unique enrichment of immune cell populations between each homogenous RT dose group, with several of these dose-dependent changes also represented in the heterogeneously treated tumors, with engagement of both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. This optimized activation of multiple immune mechanisms with distinct dose-dependent profiles within a single tumor may underlie a greater capacity of RT heterogeneity to augment anti-tumor immune response when combined with ICI, as compared to homogenous dose RT.",Mus musculus,GSE234159,2024/07/12,8.7,8.0,10.0,8.0,"This dataset examines the effects of radiation on tumor immunity in the context of immune checkpoint blockade, which is highly relevant to lung cancer immunotherapy.

A number of studies have shown that the treatment of heart failure in this animal model of cardiac hypertrophy suggests that hypertrophy and fibrosis may be reversible. However, since TAC-release protocols that improve hemodynamics by releasing physical stenosis remain undefined, the histological characteristics and molecular biological regulatory mechanisms of the reversibility of cardiac hypertrophy and fibrosis are unknown. Therefore, this study aimed to establish a TAC release model and investigate the reversibility and plasticity mechanisms of myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and angiogenesis. Four weeks post-TAC surgery, TAC release was conducted by cutting the aortic stenosis sutures. The TAC group exhibited severe myocardial hypertrophy, fibrosis, and increased angiogenesis, along with diastolic dysfunction. Conversely, the TAC-release group showed reduced hypertrophy and fibrosis, and improved diastolic function.

525,200252984,TFAM deficiency promotes mitochondrial dysfunction to drive inflammation in the corneas of dry eye disease through mtDNA stress-mediated AIM2 inflammasome activation,"Background & Aims Mitochondrial dysfunction and mtDNA stress-mediated inflammasome activation play critical roles in the pathogenesis of dry eye disease (DED). Mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) is essential for regulating mtDNA stability and mitochondrial homeostasis. However, the mechanism underling TFAM to infuence DED progression is largely unknown. As a cytosolic DNA sensor, absent in melanoma 2 (AIM2) may contribute to the development of DED. Therefore, we aimed to explore whether the role of TFAM is associated with AIM2 inflammasome activation in DED. Methods The changes in inflammation, mitochondrial function, mtDNA homeostasis and TFAM expression were analyzed in the corneas of DED mice in vivo and in HCECs under oxidative stress in vitro. The effects of TFAM knockout on mtDNA homeostasis, mitochondrial respiration and cytokine release were also investigated in HCECs. The mechanism was analyzed by RNA sequencing in the corneas of DED mice, which was further verified by the HCECs with TFAM depletion. Results We found that the corneas of DED mice and HCECs under oxidative stress exhibited inflammation, mitochondrial damage and mtDNA maintenance disruption , which were highly associated with significantly reduced TFAM protein levels. Furthermore, we demonstrated that silencing of TFAM in HCECs suppressed mitochondrial respiratory capacity, induced mtDNA released into the cytosol and triggered cytokine release. Mechanistically, cytosolic mtDNA accumulation caused by TFAM depletion activated the AIM2 inflammasome and facilitated inflammation, thereby driving DED progression. Conclusions Our findings elucidate that TFAM deficiency induces mitochondrial dysfunction and cytosolic mtDNA stress, which subsequently activates the AIM2 inflammasome, triggers inflammatory responses and promotes DED progression.

526,200248206,Lineage-specific intolerance to oncogenic drivers restricts histological transformation [ATAC-Seq],"Lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and small cell lung cancer (SCLC) are thought to originate from different epithelial cell types in the lung. Intriguingly, LUAD can histologically transform into SCLC following treatment with targeted therapies. Here we designed models to follow the conversion of LUAD to SCLC and found the barrier to histological transformation converges on tolerance to Myc, which we implicate as a lineage-specific driver of the pulmonary neuroendocrine cell. Histological transformations are frequently accompanied by activation of the Akt pathway. Manipulating this pathway permitted tolerance to Myc as an oncogenic driver, producing rare, stem-like cells, transcriptionally resembling the pulmonary basal lineage. These findings suggest histological transformation may require the plasticity inherent to the basal stem cell, enabling tolerance to previously incompatible oncogenic driver programs.",Mus musculus,GSE248206,2024/01/01,8.0,8.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset discusses the lineage-specific intolerance to oncogenic drivers in lung adenocarcinoma, which is directly relevant to lung cancer research.

In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell–mediated anti‑cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations.

In this study, we conducted CRISPR knockout screens to identify the pre-mRNA processing factor 19 (PRPF19) as a potential therapeutic target for NSCLC. Our findings revealed that PRPF19 is highly expressed in NSCLC, and its expression is negatively correlated with the clinical outcomes. Through functional validation, we confirmed that genetic ablation of PRPF19 significantly attenuated cancer progression both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, we discovered that PRPF19 plays a crucial role in regulating the precise location of Citron Kinase (CIT) within the contractile ring, thereby sustaining the normal cytokinesis processes. Inhibition of PRPF19 resulted in cytokinesis failure, leading to micronuclei formation and activating the anti-tumor immune response through the TBK1-IFNs pathway.

531,200269899,Identification of resistance mechanisms to small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TEAD-regulated transcription [RNA-seq],"The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway controls transcription by regulating nuclear abundance of YAP and TAZ, which activate transcription with the TEAD1-TEAD4 DNA-binding proteins. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of YAP and TEADs have been reported, with some now entering clinical trials for different cancers. Here, we investigated the cellular response to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, using genomic and genetic strategies. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens revealed that mutations in genes from the Hippo, MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways all modulate the cellular response to TEAD inhibition. Inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation strongly reduced YAP/TEAD target expression, whilst only mildly impacting YAP/TEAD genome binding. Additionally, expression of MAPK pathway genes was induced upon inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation, which coincided with YAP/TEAD redistribution to AP-1 transcription factor binding sites. Consistent with this, combined inhibition of TEAD and the MAPK protein MEK, synergistically blocked proliferation of several mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines and more potently reduced the growth of patient-derived lung cancers in vivo. Collectively, we reveal mechanisms by which cells can overcome small-molecule inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation and potential strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of emerging Hippo pathway targeted therapies.",Homo sapiens,GSE269899,2024/07/08,5.3,4.0,5.0,7.0,"This dataset studies resistance mechanisms to small-molecule inhibition in lung cancer, which is somewhat relevant to the query.

Herein, we exploit c-Kit signaling, a physiological pathway associated with stemness in hematopoietic progenitor cells (T cells lose expression of c-Kit during differentiation). CAR T cells with intracellular expression—but no cell-surface receptor expression—of the c-Kit D816V mutation (KITv) have upregulated STAT phosphorylation, antigen-activation-dependent proliferation, CD28- and IL-2–independent and IFN-γ–mediated costimulation, augmenting the cytotoxicity of first-generation CAR T cells. This translates to enhanced survival, including in TGF-β–rich and low-antigen-expressing solid tumor models. KITv CAR T cells have equivalent or better in vivo efficacy than second-generation CAR T cells and are susceptible to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (safety switch).

535,200266141,Macrophage-mediated myelin-recycling fuels brain cancer malignancy (RNA-Seq ex vivo),"Tumors growing in metabolically-challenged environments, such as glioblastoma in the brain, are particularly reliant on cross-talk with their tumor microenvironment (TME) to satisfy their high energetic needs. However, the intricacies of this metabolic interplay and the consequences on immune cell subset diversity and function remain largely unexplored. We interrogated the heterogeneity of the glioblastoma TME using single cell multi-omics analyses in preclinical glioblastoma mouse models and patient samples, and identified metabolically-rewired tumor-associated macrophage (TAM) subpopulations that fuel glioblastoma malignancy. These TAM subsets, termed lipid-laden macrophages (LLMs) to reflect their increased lipid metabolism activity and cholesterol storage, are epigenetically rewired, display immunosuppressive features and are enriched in the aggressive mesenchymal glioblastoma subtype. In response to TME-derived cues triggering liver-X-receptor (LXR) expression, macrophages increase engulfment of cholesterol-rich myelin debris and acquire an LLM phenotype. Subsequently, LLMs directly transfer myelin-derived lipids to cancer cells in an LXR/Abca1-dependent manner, thereby fueling the heightened metabolic demands of mesenchymal glioblastoma. Furthermore, LLM content predicts clinical outcomes and immune checkpoint blockade response in glioblastoma patients and other cancer types.

Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a component of the tumor stroma and induce phenotypes related to tumor malignancy, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness, through reciprocal interactions with cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether Ech A modulates the properties of CAFs and alleviates CAF-induced lung cancer cell migration. Interestingly, the secretion of several cytokines and chemokines stimulating cancer cell metastasis was reduced in CAF-like MRC5 cells treated with Ech A compared to untreated MRC5 cells.

538,200260908,Remodeling of anti-tumor immunity with antibodies targeting a p53 mutant,"p53 is the most mutated gene in cancer, yet there are no effective drugs targeting p53 mutants. Here, we report the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting a p53 hotspot mutation E285K (E285K-mAbs). These mAbs recognize the mutant E285K epitope without cross-reactivity against wild-type p53. They are delivered by lipid nanoparticles (LNPs) that encapsulate DNA plasmids. The LNP-pE285K-mAbs in the IgG1 formats exhibit a robust anti-tumor effect, facilitating the infiltration of immune cells, including CD8+ T cells, B cells, and NK cells. Single-cell sequencing reveals that the therapeutic effects of IgG1 are associated with reduced immune inhibitory signaling, increased MHC signaling from B cells to CD8+ T cells, and enriched anti-tumor T cell and B cell receptor profiles. The E285K-mAbs can also be made in the dimeric IgA (dIgA) format. The anti-tumor activity of IgA is dependent on PIGR, whereas that of IgG1 is dependent on TRIM21. These findings indicate that targeting specific mutant epitopes through DNA-encoded and LNP-delivered mAbs represents a novel approach for precision medicine against p53 mutants in PIGR- or TRIM21-positive cancers.",Mus musculus,GSE260908,2024/06/26,9.3,9.0,10.0,9.0,"This dataset discusses the development of monoclonal antibodies targeting a p53 mutant in cancer, with implications for lung cancer treatment.

Unfortunately, the accurate manipulation of exosomes by controlling their biodistribution still poses significant challenges. Here we overcome this limitation by developing an externally controlled delivery system for primed ANXA1 myo-exosomes (Exomyo). Effective nanocarriers are realized by immobilizing the Exomyo onto ferromagnetic nanotubes (NT-MAG) to achieve a controlled delivery and localization of Exomyo into skeletal muscles by an applied external magnetic field. Quantitative muscle-level analyses revealed that macrophages dominate the uptake of Exomyo from NT-MAG in vivo, to synergistically promote beneficial muscle responses in a murine animal model of Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (DMD) thanks to the successful localization of therapeutic Exomyo upon systemic injection. These findings provide valuable insights into the development of exosome-based therapies for muscle diseases and in general highlight the formulation of effective functional nanocarriers aimed at optimizing exosome biodistribution.",Mus musculus,GSE263142,2024/07/23,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on exosome delivery in muscle diseases, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

However, their phenotypic and transcriptomic hallmarks and mechanisms of activation remain uncertain. We performed single-cell RNA-Seq (scRNA-Seq) on non-human primate (NHP) and patient-derived T cells to interrogate CARneg T cells following B cell targeted CAR-T cell therapy. In a NHP model, we observed a distinct population of activated CD8+ CARneg T cells emerging during CAR-T cell expansion. These bystander CD8+ CARneg T cells exhibited a unique transcriptional signature with upregulation of NK-cell markers (KIR3DL2, CD160, KLRD1), chemokines and chemokine receptors (CCL5, XCL1, CCR9), and downregulation of naive T cell-associated genes (SELL, CD28). A transcriptionally similar population was identified in patients following Tisangelecleucel infusion. Mechanistic studies revealed that IL-2 and IL-15 exposure induced bystander-like CD8+ T cells.

We explored a major dependency of small cell lung cancer as a therapeutic target. Nearly all of SCLCs have telomerase activity and they are dependent on this enzyme for their ability to continuously divide. We utilized a nucleoside analog, 6-Thio-2’-deoxyguanosine (6TdG), that is preferentially recognized by telomerase to promote telomere dysfunction. Low and intermittent doses of 6TdG inhibited tumor growth and metastasis from the primary tumors. Anti-tumor activity of 6TdG was associated with decrease in cancer initiation cell (CIC) markers L1CAM/CD133 and increase in visibility to innate and adaptive immunity. Mechanistically, 6TdG depleted CICs and induced type-I interferon signaling by activating tumor STING. We confirmed the functional essential role of CIC markers L1CAM/CD133 in SCLC tumor initiation.

546,200237427,Single-cell transcriptomics reveals distinct molecular alterations of human renal cell carcinoma-derived endothelial cells that are stable in ex vivo primary culture [RNA-Seq],"Even though tumor endothelial cells are a key component of the tumor microenvironment and represent the main interface between tumor cells and the host’s circulation and immune system, their phenotypes and functional properties are relatively poorly understood. To address this deficit, we purified tumor and matched normal endothelial cells from highly vascularized kidney cancer specimens and performed single cell RNA-seq to characterize endothelial cell gene expression patterns and heterogeneity. We found that tumor endothelial cells from multiple donors shared a common phenotype with increased expression of pathways related to extracellular matrix regulation, cell-cell communication and insulin growth factor signaling. We also found that while normal endothelial cells from kidney and liver were divergent, most tumor endothelial cells from kidney and liver cancer shared common gene expression signatures suggesting a congruence of tumor endothelial cell phenotypes. Using RNA-seq, we determined that many of the differentially regulated genes between tumor and normal endothelial cells were maintained in primary culture, which in turn permitted study of their functional phenotypes in vitro.

Given the increasingly recognized complexity of CD8+ T cell differentiation that occurs in response to chronic antigen stimulation, it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states are critical for the response to ICB, as well as the anatomic sites at which ICB-mediated reinvigoration of these T cells occurs. We used paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile endogenous, tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells isolated from tumors, tumor-draining lymph nodes, and spleens of mice treated with ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population of T cells in the spleen which underwent the greatest expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to the majority of tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increasing concentrations of systemic antigen perturbed the differentiation of this phenotype towards an exhausted_KLR state, while a lack of cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigen blunted differentiation in the spleen. We identified an analogous population of exhausted_KLR CD8+ T cells in matched human tumor and blood samples that exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability.

552,200241977,IFN -induced treatment of a Human Lung Adenocarcinoma Cell Line is Mediated by an Environmental Chemical Receptor (AhR) through PD-L1 and IDO Control (a549 bulk RNA),"While immunotherapy has shown efficacy in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) patients, many respond only partially or not at all. One limitation in improving outcomes is the lack of a complete understanding of factors regulating immune checkpoint targets. Here, we sought to address a possible link between an environmental chemical receptor implicated in NSCLC and immune regulation, the aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR), and a known but counterintuitive mediator of immunosuppression, IFN , in regulation of two immune checkpoints, PD-L1 and the IDO1, in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD). To this end we used AhR, PD-L1, and IFN R gene-edited LUAD cell lines, a syngeneic LUAD mouse model, bulk- and single cell-RNA sequencing of LUADs and tumor-infiltrating leukocytes, and existing human transcriptomic databases. The data demonstrate that: 1) the AhR regulates both PD-L1 and IDO1 in murine and human LUAD cells, 2) AhR-driven IDO1 results in production of Kyn which likely mediates an AhR→IDO1→Kyn→AhR amplification loop, 3) the previously characterized induction by IFN of PD-L1 and IDO is mediated by the AhR, 4) transplantation of LUAD cells in which the AhR is deleted results in long-term tumor immunity in approximately half of the mice; slow growing tumors in the other half exhibit significantly higher densities of CD4+ and CD8+ T cells expressing immunocompetence markers, and 5) deletion of either IFN R1 or PD-L1 does not provide the same level of immune protection as AhR deletion.

553,200242790,Repeated peripheral infusions of anti-EGFRvIII CAR T cells in combination with pembrolizumab remodel the tumor microenvironment in de novo glioblastoma,"Treatment efficacy with chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cell therapy in glioblastoma (GBM) is undermined by an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment (TME). We previously showed that CAR T cell therapy targeting epidermal growth factor receptor variant III (EGFRvIII) produces anti-tumor activity against recurrent GBM and causes upregulation of programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) in the TME. Here, we conducted a phase I trial to study the safety and tolerability of CART-EGFRvIII cells administered concomitantly with the PD-1 inhibitor pembrolizumab in patients with newly diagnosed, EGFRvIII+ GBM (n=7). Treatment was well tolerated in this small cohort without incidence of dose-limiting toxicity. However, no signal of efficacy was detected with a median progression-free survival of 5.2 months (90% CI, 2.9 – 6.0 months) and overall survival of 11.8 months (90 % CI, 9.2 – 14.2 months). We aimed to elucidate reasons for limited efficacy through correlative analyses. Using BBZ qPCR, we found circulating CAR T cells in 5 out of 7 patients at the time of repeat resection, but only in 1 patient in the tumor. However, shared T-cell receptors (TCRs) were found between the infusion product and the relapsed tumors, which could indicate an infiltration but lack of persistence of the CAR T cells. We further compared the tumor microenvironment of the tumors harvested before and after CAR+aPD1 administration using single cell RNA sequencing and observed comparable proportions of the major immune cell subsets. However, the myeloid and T cells infiltrating the tumors significantly evolved, with more exhausted, regulatory, and IFN-stimulated T cells at the relapse. At that time, the amount of IFN-stimulated T cells positively correlated with time from relapse to death. Together, these findings suggest that the combination of CAR T cells and PD-1 inhibition in GBM is safe and biologically active but, given the lack of efficacy, also indicate a need to consider alternative immunotherapeutic strategies.

We have reported the development of BiTE-sialidase fusion proteins that enhance tumor cell susceptibility to BiTE-mediated cytolysis by T cells via targeted desialylation at the BiTE-induced T cell-tumor cell interface. Targeted desialylation results in better immunological synapse formation, T-cell activation and effector function. As a result, BiTE-sialidase fusion proteins show remarkably increased efficacy in inducing T-cell-dependent tumor cell cytolysis in response to target antigens compared to the parent BiTE molecules alone. This enhanced function is seen both in vitro and in in vivo xenograft and syngeneic solid tumor mouse models. Our findings highlight BiTE-sialidase fusion proteins as promising candidates for the development of next-generation bispecific T-cell engaging molecules for cancer immunotherapy. This transcriptomic dataset documents the effect of BiTE-sialidase vs uncojugated BiTE on T cells including the upregulation of effector associated genes.",Homo sapiens,GSE245991,2024/06/05,6.7,8.0,6.0,6.0,"This dataset discusses enhancing T cell engagement in cancer therapies, which is relevant to immunotherapy approaches.

557,200234976,Pan-cancer mapping of single CD8+ T cell profiles reveals a TCF1:CXCR6 axis regulating CD28 co-stimulation and anti-tumor immunity III,"Cytotoxic CD8+ T cells need to persist and function in diverse tumor microenvironments to exert their effects. Here, we developed Generalizable Matrix Decomposition Framework (GMDF), a matrix factorization algorithm that recovers both shared and tumor type-specific transcriptional programs from diverse data sets, and applied it to a scRNA-seq compendium of 38,852 CD8+ T cells from 141 patients spanning nine different human cancers. Our meta-single-cell analyses uncovered a pan-cancer T cell dysfunction program that was predictive of clinical responses to checkpoint blockade in melanoma and highlighted CXCR6 as a pan-cancer marker of chronically activated T cells. CXCR6 transcription was activated by AP-1 factors and repressed by TCF1. In mouse models, CXCR6 expression increased with tumor progression and upon checkpoint blockade. CXCR6 deletion in CD8+ T cells increased apoptosis of PD1+Tim3+ cells and compromised tumor growth control due to suppressed expression of survival factors and CD28 co-stimulation, revealing a role for CXCR6 in opposing PD1-mediated suppression of CD28 signaling. Our application of GMDF led us to discover a TCF1:CXCR6 axis that counterbalances PD1-mediated suppression of CD8+ cell responses and is essential for effective anti-tumor immunity.",Mus musculus,GSE234976,2024/07/02,7.3,6.0,8.0,8.0,"This dataset investigates CD8+ T cell profiles across various cancers, including potential implications for anti-tumor immunity.

560,200248348,A Th17 cell-intrinsic glutathione/mitochondrial-IL-22 axis protects against intestinal inflammation,"The intestinal tract generates significant reactive oxygen species (ROS), but the role of T cell antioxidant mechanisms in maintaining intestinal homeostasis is poorly understood. We used T cell-specific ablation of the catalytic subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (Gclc), which impaired glutathione (GSH) production, crucially reducing IL-22 production by Th17 cells in the lamina propria, which is critical for gut protection. Under steady-state conditions, Gclc deficiency did not alter cytokine secretion; however, C. rodentium infection induced increased ROS and disrupted mitochondrial function and TFAM-driven mitochondrial gene expression, resulting in decreased cellular ATP. These changes impaired the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, reducing phosphorylation of 4E-BP1 and consequently limiting IL-22 translation. The resultant low IL-22 levels led to poor bacterial clearance, severe intestinal damage, and high mortality. Our findings highlight a previously unrecognized, essential role of Th17 cell-intrinsic GSH in promoting mitochondrial function and cellular signaling for IL-22 protein synthesis, which is critical for intestinal integrity and defense against gastrointestinal infections.",Mus musculus,GSE248348,2024/07/01,1.0,1.0,1.0,1.0,"This dataset focuses on Th17 cells and their role in intestinal inflammation, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapies for it.
