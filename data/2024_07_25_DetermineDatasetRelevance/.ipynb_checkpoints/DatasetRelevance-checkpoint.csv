0,200245247,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS4182_ATAC],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",GSE245247,2024/07/01,Not Relevant,2/3,"This dataset focuses on ferroptosis and its mechanisms in lung cancer cells, which is not directly related to immunotherapies for lung cancer.

1,200252587,Regulatory role of echinochrome A in cancer-associated fibroblast-mediated lung cancer cell migration,"Echinochrome A (Ech A), a marine biosubstance isolated from sea urchins, is a strong antioxidant, and its clinical form, histochrome, is being used to treat several diseases, such as ophthalmic, cardiovascular, and metabolic diseases. Cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) are a component of the tumor stroma and induce phenotypes related to tumor malignancy, including epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) and cancer stemness, through reciprocal interactions with cancer cells. Here, we investigated whether Ech A modulates the properties of CAFs and alleviates CAF-induced lung cancer cell migration. Interestingly, the secretion of several cytokines and chemokines stimulating cancer cell metastasis was reduced in CAF-like MRC5 cells treated with Ech A compared to untreated MRC5 cells. Moreover, while conditioned medium from MRC5 cells enhanced the migration of non-small cell lung cancer cells, conditioned medium from MRC5 cells treated with Ech A suppressed cancer cell migration. In conclusion, we suggest that Ech A might be a potent adjuvant that increases the efficacy of cancer treatments to mitigate lung cancer progression.",GSE252587,2024/06/26,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset investigates the role of echinochrome A in modulating cancer-associated fibroblast effects on lung cancer cell migration.

3,200242951,Contribution of crosstalk of mesothelial and tumoral epithelial cells in pleural metastasis of lung cancer,"Tumor metastasis commonly affects pleura in advanced lung cancer and is related to poor prognosis, but without systematic investigation on different cell types and their crosstalk at single cell resolution. Here, by integrating 180785 single cells from lung cancer and control samples, the most distinctive transcriptome profiles between tumor and control were revealed in mesothelial cells, which is the predominate cell type of pleura. Four subtypes were divided, including one predominately identified in malignant pleural effusion which was characterized by enriched cancer related pathways (e.g., cell migration) along evolutionary trajectory from normal mesothelial cells. Cancer-associated mesothelial cells exhibited varied interactions with different subtypes of malignant epithelial cells, and multiple ligands/receptors exhibited significant correlation with poor prognosis. Experimentally, mesothelial cells can increase the migration ability of lung cancer cells through co-culturing assay, and EGFR was the only affected gene in cancer cells that exhibited interaction with mesothelial cells and was associated with poor prognosis. Using EGFR antagonist cetuximab prevented the increased invasiveness of lung cancer cells induced by mesothelial cells. Moreover, EPGN-EGFR interaction was supported through spatial distribution analysis, revealing the significant proximity between EPGN+ mesothelial cells and EGFR+ epithelial cells. Our findings highlighted the important role of mesothelial cells and their interactions with cancer cells in pleural metastasis of lung cancer, which may facilitate cancer progression.",GSE242951,2024/06/26,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset examines the crosstalk between mesothelial cells and tumor cells in lung cancer metastasis.

4,200251937,In situ targeted gene expression analysis of Marjolin ulcers,"Marjolin's ulcer is a a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy that can arise on previously injured skin, established scars, and chronic non-healing wounds. It is most often found in burn scars, but it can also occur in other types of wounds, including venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, and vaccination sites. The most common histological type of Marjolin’s ulcers is squamous cell carcinoma, however basal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and sarcomas have also been reported. All parts of the body could potentially be affected yet the lower extremities are the anatomic sites most commonly involved. While SCCs commonly have a metastasis rate of 0.5 to 3.0 percent, those arising from burn scars metastasize at a rate in excess of 30 percent. The 5-year survival after a diagnosis of Marjolin’s ulcer was found to be 50 percent. The transformation to a malignancy can occur either chronically, over a period of more than 35 years, or occasionally within a year of the original injury. The exact mechanism of this transformation is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to chronic keratinocyte dysfunction during the healing process of severe burn wounds. Surgical excision is the main treatment for Marjolin's ulcer and provides the best chance of survival. In a previous study, we investigated the bulk transcriptional changes that lead to Marjolin's ulcer by comparing global gene expression changes between squamous cells present in a squamous cell carcinoma versus those present within Marjolin's ulcer (MU) (Sinha et. al. JBCR 2017). This imparted novel insights into mechanisms underlying divergent clinical features of these cutaneous cancers. The goal of our current study is to characterize a new case of Marjolin's ulcer in a patient under our care by analyzing the cell types, their frequencies, and their individual transcriptional responses within a burn scar versus within Marjolin's ulcer. To achieve this, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on two excised tissues: 1. a sample from the center of the tumor (tumor core), and 2. another sample from the margin of tumor-free scar tissue.",GSE251937,2024/07/21,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset discusses Marjolin's ulcers, which are aggressive cutaneous malignancies unrelated to lung cancer or its immunotherapy.

5,200246354,GCN2 is a determinant of the response to WEE1 kinase inhibition in small-cell lung cancer,"Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) are in dire need of more effective therapeutic options. Frequent disruption of the G1 checkpoint in SCLC cells creates a greater dependency of these cells on the G2/M checkpoint to maintain genomic integrity. Indeed, in pre-clinical models, inhibiting the G2/M kinase WEE1 shows promise in inhibiting SCLC growth. However, toxicity and acquired resistance limit the clinical effectiveness of this strategy. Here we conducted CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes influencing the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 kinase inhibition. These screens uncovered a role for the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway in modulating the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 inhibition. Rapid activation of GCN2 upon WEE1 inhibition triggers a stress response. Pharmacological activation of the GCN2 pathway synergizes with WEE1 inhibition. Thus, activation of the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway represents a novel approach for augmenting the efficacy of WEE1 inhibitors in SCLC.",GSE246354,2024/07/16,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset addresses the response of small-cell lung cancer cells to WEE1 kinase inhibition.

8,200245801,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [RNA-Seq],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments. The HMGA1 effects of gene expression go beyond senescence and appear to be relevant in other contexts, such as lung cancer.",GSE245801,2024/07/08,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset discusses the role of HMGA1 in chromatin architecture shifts linked to cancer.

10,200271086,Personalized dendritic cell vaccine facilitates the preparation of neoantigen-reactive T cells for adoptive transfer (scTCR-Seq),"Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) using neoantigen-specific T cells is an effective immunotherapeutic strategy. However, the difficulty in identifying and screening neoantigen-specific T cells limits its widespread application. Here, we prepared neoantigen-reactive T cells (NRTs) after immunization with a tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccine (OCDC) for ACT. Our results demonstrated that the OCDC vaccine could induce a neoantigen-specific immune response, and it was feasible to prepare NRTs by loading immunogenic neoantigens onto DCs and coculturing them with spleen lymphocytes from mice immunized with the OCDC vaccine. We then transferred these NRTs back to the LL/2 tumor-bearing mice after OCDC vaccine immunization and found that OCDC vaccine and NRTs adoptive transfer combination treatment could induce a stronger antitumor response. Furthermore, we found that infused NRTs could migrate into the tumor microenvironment to exert antitumor effects. Our research provides a new and convenient method of preparing NRTs for ACT.

SARS-CoV-2 infection is often accompanied by renal manifestations such as acute kidney injury and kidney fibrosis, however there is a lack of effective treatment options that also address renal involvement. In this study, golden hamsters were inoculated with Delta variant SARS- CoV-2, and given either vehicle or Andrographis paniculata (AP) standardized extract as treatment. Hamster kidney tissues were then subjected to transcriptomics, proteomics, and metabolomics analysis.

13,200264734,Metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors to protect plants against viral induced cellular damage,"RNA viruses co-opt host intracellular structures to create specialized replication sites and advance infection. The response of the host to this membrane disruption is poorly understood. In this study, we explore Arabidopsis thaliana's reaction to three distinct viruses that commandeer varying cellular compartments. Our findings reveal autophagy is significantly induced within systemically infected tissues, with autophagy disruption rendering plants highly sensitive to infection. Contrary to being an antiviral defense, quantitative analyses of viral RNA and proteomes establish autophagy as a critical component of the host's tolerance mechanism. Further analysis of mitochondrial hijacking by the Turnip Crinkle Virus has shown that despite perturbing mitochondrial integrity, the virus does not trigger a typical mitophagy response. Instead, viral infection activates a distinct selective autophagy mechanism, where oligomeric metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors and degrade key executors of defense and cell death. Altogether, our study reveals an autophagy-regulated metabolic rheostats that gauges cellular integrity during viral infection.",GSE264734,2024/07/23,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset investigates plant responses to viral infections and is irrelevant to lung cancer or immunotherapy.; This dataset relates to plant responses to viral infections and is not relevant to lung cancer or immunotherapy.; This dataset explores plant responses to viral infections, which is unrelated to lung cancer or its treatment.

14,200247647,Cell state and transcription factor modulation during extended CD8+ T-cell expansion ex vivo,"Adoptive cell therapy is fast becoming a cornerstone of modern tumour immunotherapy. It relies on the relatively long-term (>2 week) ex vivo expansion of T cells either in the form of tumour-infiltrating cells, or bulk cells modified with the expression of heterologous signaling proteins, e.g., chimeric antigen receptors. However, relatively little is known about the developmental trajectories of T cells under these conditions at the systems level, and whether entire genetic pathways could be manipulated for clinical advantage. Using bulk RNA-seq analysis of T cells expanded and rested over a 17-day period, we provide a resource of how gene expression changes as cells transition through distinct cellular states over the course of activation and ex-vivo expansion. We also performed experiments to investigate the role of FOSL1 in T-cell function.",GSE247647,2024/07/22,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset explores the modulation of CD8+ T-cell states during ex vivo expansion, providing insights into T-cell therapy strategies for lung cancer immunotherapy.; This dataset provides insights into ex vivo T-cell expansion, which is central to developing effective immunotherapy approaches for lung cancer.; This dataset focuses on T-cell expansion and its implications for adoptive cell therapy in cancer immunotherapy.

Here, we established a comprehensive resource of human B cells by integrating single-cell RNA-sequencing data of B cells from 649 patients across 19 major cancer types. We demonstrated substantial heterogeneity in their total abundance and subtype compositions and observed IgG-skewness of antibody-secreting cell isotypes. Moreover, we identified stress-response memory B cells and tumor-associated atypical B cells (TAABs), two tumor-enriched subpopulations shared in a pan-cancer manner and with prognostic potential. In particular, TAABs, characterized by a high clonal expansion level and proliferative capacity, as well as close interactions with activated CD4 T cells in tumors, are predictive of immunotherapy response.

16,200252382,ATACseq of TNBC cell lines treated with EZH2i (tazemetostat) and/or AKTi (ipatasertib),"Triple negative breast cancer (TNBC) is the most aggressive breast cancer subtype and has the highest rate of recurrence1. The predominant standard of care for advanced TNBC is systemic chemotherapy with or without immunotherapy, however responses are typically short-lived1,2. Thus, there is an urgent need to develop more effective treatments. PI3K pathway components represent plausible therapeutic targets, as approximately 70% of TNBCs have PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations3–6. However, unlike hormone receptor-positive tumors, it is still unclear if or how PI3K pathway inhibitors will be effective in triple-negative disease7. Here we identify a promising AKT inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors potently synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, and promote robust tumor regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once differentiated, these agents kill TNBCs by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Finally, using machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used for patient selection. Together these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumor type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumors from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.",GSE252382,2024/07/08,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset pertains to triple-negative breast cancer and does not address lung cancer or its immunotherapy.; This dataset relates to triple negative breast cancer and does not focus on lung cancer or related immunotherapies.; This dataset investigates therapeutic options for triple-negative breast cancer, which does not pertain to lung cancer.

In this pilot study, we exposed two pigtail macaques (PTMs) chronically infected with SIVmac239, exhibiting from very low to no CD4 T cells across all compartments, to SARS-CoV-2. We monitored the disease progression, viral replication and evolution, and compared these outcomes with SIV-naïve PTMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. No overt signs of COVID-19 disease were observed in either animal, and the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and evolution in the SIVmac239 PTMs were indistinguishable from those in the SIV-naïve PTMs in all sampled mucosal sites.

22,200245802,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [ChIP-Seq],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments. The HMGA1 effects of gene expression go beyond senescence and appear to be relevant in other contexts, such as lung cancer.",GSE245802,2024/07/08,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset discusses HMGA1's role in chromatin architecture and gene expression, with implications in various cancers including lung cancer.

24,200247053,A pair of NUCLEAR FACTOR Y transcription factors act as positive regulators in jasmonate signaling and disease resistance in Arabidopsis,"The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) regulates plant growth and immunity by orchestrating a genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming. In the resting stage, JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as main repressors to regulate the expression of JA-responsive genes in the JA signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying de-repression of JA-responsive genes in response to JA treatment remain elusive. Here, we report two nuclear factor Y transcription factors NF- YB2 and NF-YB3 (thereafter YB2 and YB3) play key roles in such de-repression in Arabidopsis. YB2 and YB3 function redundantly and positively regulate plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea ， which are specially required for transcriptional activation of a set of JA-responsive genes following inoculation. Furthermore, YB2 and YB3 modulated their expression through direct occupancy and interaction with histone demethylase Ref6 to remove repressive histone modifications. Moreover, YB2 and YB3 physically interacted with JAZ repressorsand negatively modulated their abundance, which in turn attenuated the inhibition of JAZ proteins on the transcription of JA- responsive genes, thereby activating JA response and promoting disease resistance. Overall, our study reveals the positive regulator of YB2 and YB3 in JA signaling by positively regulating transcription of JA-responsive genes and negatively modulating the abundance of JAZ proteins.",GSE247053,2024/07/15,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset is focused on plant hormone signaling in Arabidopsis and does not relate to human lung cancer or immunotherapy.

25,200245242,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3789_snRNA],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",GSE245242,2024/07/01,Relevant,3/3,"The research identifies ferroptosis suppressors in cancer, highlighting potential therapeutic vulnerabilities that could be relevant to lung cancer.

26,200236719,Synthetic essentiality of thymine DNA glycosylase in p53-deficient cancer [ChIP-seq],"Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) is a versatile protein involved in DNA mismatch repair, DNA demethylation, and transcriptional regulation. Here, we identify TDG as a synthetic essential effector in p53-deficient tumours. We found that deletion of TDG inhibits cell proliferation specifically in p53-deficient cancer cells. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we demonstrate that depletion of TDG suppresses tumour growth in the p53-deficient context. Notably, A novel and selective inhibitor developed to disrupt the DNA binding activity of TDG exhibits therapeutic efficacy against p53-deficient tumours in both cellular and xenograft models. Mechanistically, TDG coordinates with p53 to orchestrate the transcription of RNA helicase DHX9, which functions to eliminate dsRNA. Depletion of TDG in p53-deficient cells results in the downregulation of DHX9 and aberrant cytoplasmic double-strand (dsRNA) accumulation derived from Alu elements, subsequently activating the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS mediated antiviral response. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the depletion of TDG in p53-deficient tumours facilitates the recruitment of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. We observed that TDG inhibition combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) achieved a strong synergistic anti-tumour effect in p53-deficient tumours. This study highlights the function of TDG in maintaining p53-deficient tumour growth and provides an alternative therapeutic target for p53-deficient cancers.",GSE236719,2024/06/21,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset explores the synthetic essentiality of TDG in p53-deficient lung adenocarcinoma, revealing significant insights into tumor growth and potential immunotherapy targets.

27,200233097,STAT3 inhibition permits epigenetic reprogramming and TLR9/IRF8-driven differentiation of inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia [RRBS],"Cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells but achieving leukemic cell immunogenicity proved challenging in clinical setting. Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects. These findings support further development of CpG-STAT3 inhibitors as a new bi-functional agents for AML immunotherapy.",GSE233097,2024/07/23,Relevant,2/3,"The study investigates the role of STAT3 in acute myeloid leukemia and its implications for immune stimulation.

28,200237615,53BP1 loss elicits cGAS-STING-dependent antitumor immunity in ovarian and pancreatic cancer,"53BP1 nucleates the anti-end resection machinery at DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), thereby countering BRCA1 activity. Loss of 53BP1 leads to DNA end processing and homologous recombination (HR) in BRCA1-deficient cells. Consequently, BRCA1-mutant tumors, typically sensitive to PARP inhibitors (PARPi), become resistant in the absence of 53BP1. Here, we demonstrate that the 'leaky' DNA end resection in the absence of 53BP1 results in increased micronuclei and cytoplasmic dsDNA, leading to activation of the cGAS-STING pathway and pro-inflammatory signaling. This enhances CD8+ T cell infiltration, activates macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells, and impedes tumor growth. Loss of 53BP1 correlates with a response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) and improved overall survival. Immunohistochemical assessment of 53BP1 in two malignancies, high grade serous ovarian cancer (HGSOC)s and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC)s, which are refractory to ICBs, revealed that lower 53BP1 levels correlated with an increased adaptive and innate immune response. Finally, BRCA1-deficient tumors that develop resistance to PARPi due to the loss of 53BP1 are susceptible to ICB. Therefore, we conclude that 53BP1 is critical for tumor immunogenicity and underpins the response to ICB. Our results support including 53BP1 expression as an exploratory biomarker in ICB trials for malignancies typically refractory to immunotherapy.",GSE237615,2024/07/09,Relevant,2/3,"This dataset discusses the role of 53BP1 in tumor immunogenicity and its implications for immune checkpoint blockade in cancers, including lung cancer.

31,200270541,Mechanisms of response and tolerance to active RAS inhibition in KRAS-mutant NSCLC,"Resistance to inactive state-selective RASG12C inhibitors frequently entails accumulation of RASGTP, rendering effective inhibition of active RAS potentially desirable. Here, we evaluated the anti-tumor activity of the RAS(ON) multi-selective tri-complex inhibitor RMC-7977 and dissected mechanisms of response and tolerance in KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC. Broad-spectrum, reversible RASGTP inhibition with or without concurrent covalent targeting of active RASG12C yielded superior and differentiated antitumor activity across diverse co-mutational KRASG12C-mutant NSCLC mouse models of primary or acquired RASG12C(ON) or (OFF) inhibitor resistance. Interrogation of time-resolved single cell transcriptional responses established an in vivo atlas of multi-modal acute and chronic RAS pathway inhibition in the NSCLC ecosystem and uncovered a regenerative mucinous transcriptional program that supports long-term tumor cell persistence.

35,200234919,Single-cell transcriptomics of Marjolin ulcers,"Marjolin's ulcer is a a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy that can arise on previously injured skin, established scars, and chronic non-healing wounds. It is most often found in burn scars, but it can also occur in other types of wounds, including venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, and vaccination sites. The most common histological type of Marjolin’s ulcers is squamous cell carcinoma, however basal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and sarcomas have also been reported. All parts of the body could potentially be affected yet the lower extremities are the anatomic sites most commonly involved. While SCCs commonly have a metastasis rate of 0.5 to 3.0 percent, those arising from burn scars metastasize at a rate in excess of 30 percent. The 5-year survival after a diagnosis of Marjolin’s ulcer was found to be 50 percent. The transformation to a malignancy can occur either chronically, over a period of more than 35 years, or occasionally within a year of the original injury. The exact mechanism of this transformation is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to chronic keratinocyte dysfunction during the healing process of severe burn wounds. Surgical excision is the main treatment for Marjolin's ulcer and provides the best chance of survival. In a previous study, we investigated the bulk transcriptional changes that lead to Marjolin's ulcer by comparing global gene expression changes between squamous cells present in a squamous cell carcinoma versus those present within Marjolin's ulcer (MU) (Sinha et. al. JBCR 2017). This imparted novel insights into mechanisms underlying divergent clinical features of these cutaneous cancers. The goal of our current study is to characterize a new case of Marjolin's ulcer in a patient under our care by analyzing the cell types, their frequencies, and their individual transcriptional responses within a burn scar versus within Marjolin's ulcer.

36,200272045,Identification of mutant KRAS-related genes associated with malignant phenotypes in NSCLC,"Oncogenic KRAS is found in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we conducted microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that although the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is significantly downregulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho–epidermal growth factor receptor, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment, but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs.

KRAS, for example, is the most frequently mutated oncogene in human cancers, yet strategies targeting its downstream signaling kinases have failed to produce durable treatment responses. Here, we developed multiple models of acquired resistance to second-generation MAPK inhibitors across KRAS-mutant pancreatic, colorectal, and lung cancers, then probed the long-term events enabling survival against this class of drugs. These studies revealed that resistance emerges secondary to large-scale transcriptional adaptations that are diverse and tumor-specific. Transcriptional reprogramming extends beyond the well-established early response, and instead represents a dynamic, evolved process that is refined to attain a stably resistant phenotype. Mechanistic and translational studies reveal that resistance to sustained MAPK inhibition is broadly susceptible to manipulation of the epigenetic machinery, and that Mediator kinase, in particular, can be co-targeted at a bottleneck point to prevent diverse, tumor-specific resistance programs.",GSE234378,2024/06/26,Relevant,3/3,"This study on transcriptional adaptations in KRAS-mutant cancers addresses challenges in targeting KRAS, relevant for understanding potential immunotherapy resistance mechanisms.; This study on resistance mechanisms in KRAS-mutant cancers could inform strategies to improve the effectiveness of lung cancer immunotherapy.; This dataset tackles the challenge of acquired resistance in KRAS-mutant cancers, including lung cancer.

PI3K pathway components represent plausible therapeutic targets, as approximately 70% of TNBCs have PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations3–6. However, unlike hormone receptor-positive tumors, it is still unclear if or how PI3K pathway inhibitors will be effective in triple-negative disease7. Here we identify a promising AKT inhibitor-based therapeutic combination for TNBC. Specifically, we show that AKT inhibitors potently synergize with agents that suppress the histone methyltransferase, EZH2, and promote robust tumor regression in multiple TNBC models in vivo. AKT and EZH2 inhibitors exert these effects by first cooperatively driving basal-like TNBC cells into a more differentiated, luminal-like state, which cannot be effectively induced by either agent alone. Once differentiated, these agents kill TNBCs by hijacking signals that normally drive mammary gland involution. Finally, using machine learning approach, we developed a classifier that can be used for patient selection. Together these findings identify a promising therapeutic strategy for this highly aggressive tumor type and illustrate how deregulated epigenetic enzymes can insulate tumors from oncogenic vulnerabilities. These studies also reveal how developmental tissue-specific cell death pathways may be co-opted for therapeutic benefit.",GSE251708,2024/07/08,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset focuses on triple negative breast cancer and the efficacy of certain inhibitors in that context, with no mention of lung cancer or immunotherapy.

41,200242839,PD-1 is induced on tumor-associated macrophages in obesity to directly restrain anti-tumor immunity,"Obesity is a leading risk factor for progression and metastasis of many cancers1,2, yet can also promote improved survival for some cancers3-5 and enhance responses to some immune checkpoint blockade therapies6-8. The role of the immune system in the obesity-cancer connection and how obesity influences immunotherapy, however, remain unclear. While PD-1 expression by macrophages has been described9-12, we found that obesity selectively induced PD-1 on macrophages and that PD-1 directly impaired macrophage function. Single cell RNA sequencing of murine colorectal carcinoma tumors showed obesity remodeled myeloid and T cell populations, with fewer clonally expanded effector T cells and increased abundance of PD-1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Cytokines and molecules associated with obesity, including IL-6, leptin, and insulin, and the unsaturated fatty acid palmitate, induced PD-1 expression on macrophages in a glycolysis-dependent manner and that MTORC1 pathway signaling is essential for PD1 expression. PD-1+ TAMs had increased mitochondrial respiration, fatty acid metabolism and cell cylewhile PD-1- TAMs had increased inflammatory signature , phagocytosis and antigen presentation to T cells. These patterns were directly regulated by PD-1, as recombinant PD-L1 reduced macrophage glycolysis, phagocytic capacity and antigen presentation, and this was reversed with blocking PD-1 antibody. Further, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose prevented the increase in CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II that would otherwise occur with anti-PD-1 treatment. Conversely, PD-1-deficient Pdcd1-/- TAMs had high rates of glycolysis, phagocytosis, and expression of MHC-II. Myeloid-specific PD-1 deficiency correlated with slower tumor growth, enhanced TAM antigen presentation capability, and increased CD8 T cell activation together with reduced markers of exhaustion. These findings show metabolic signaling and type 1 inflammatory cues in obesity induces PD-1-mediated suppression of TAM function and reveal a unique macrophage-specific and glycolysis-dependent mechanism to modulate immune tumor surveillance and checkpoint blockade. This may contribute to increased cancer risk yet improved response to PD-1 blockade in TAM-enriched tumors and obesity.",GSE242839,2024/07/19,Relevant,2/3,"While this dataset discusses PD-1 in relation to tumor-associated macrophages, it is primarily focused on obesity's effects on cancer immunity, not specifically on lung cancer or immunotherapies for it.

43,200247054,A pair of NUCLEAR FACTOR Y transcription factors act as positive regulators in jasmonate signaling and disease resistance in Arabidopsis,"The plant hormone jasmonate (JA) regulates plant growth and immunity by orchestrating a genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming. In the resting stage, JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as main repressors to regulate the expression of JA-responsive genes in the JA signaling pathway. However, the mechanisms underlying de-repression of JA-responsive genes in response to JA treatment remain elusive. Here, we report two nuclear factor Y transcription factors NF- YB2 and NF-YB3 (thereafter YB2 and YB3) play key roles in such de-repression in Arabidopsis. YB2 and YB3 function redundantly and positively regulate plant resistance against necrotrophic pathogen Botrytis cinerea ， which are specially required for transcriptional activation of a set of JA-responsive genes following inoculation. Furthermore, YB2 and YB3 modulated their expression through direct occupancy and interaction with histone demethylase Ref6 to remove repressive histone modifications. Moreover, YB2 and YB3 physically interacted with JAZ repressorsand negatively modulated their abundance, which in turn attenuated the inhibition of JAZ proteins on the transcription of JA- responsive genes, thereby activating JA response and promoting disease resistance. Overall, our study reveals the positive regulator of YB2 and YB3 in JA signaling by positively regulating transcription of JA-responsive genes and negatively modulating the abundance of JAZ proteins.",GSE247054,2024/07/15,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset is focused on plant biology and jasmonate signaling, which has no connection to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell–mediated anti‑cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations.

Given the increasingly recognized complexity of CD8+ T cell differentiation that occurs in response to chronic antigen stimulation, it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states are critical for the response to ICB, as well as the anatomic sites at which ICB-mediated reinvigoration of these T cells occurs. We used paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile endogenous, tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells isolated from tumors, tumor-draining lymph nodes, and spleens of mice treated with ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population of T cells in the spleen which underwent the greatest expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to the majority of tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increasing concentrations of systemic antigen perturbed the differentiation of this phenotype towards an exhausted_KLR state, while a lack of cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigen blunted differentiation in the spleen. We identified an analogous population of exhausted_KLR CD8+ T cells in matched human tumor and blood samples that exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability.

47,200269899,Identification of resistance mechanisms to small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TEAD-regulated transcription [RNA-seq],"The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway controls transcription by regulating nuclear abundance of YAP and TAZ, which activate transcription with the TEAD1-TEAD4 DNA-binding proteins. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of YAP and TEADs have been reported, with some now entering clinical trials for different cancers. Here, we investigated the cellular response to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, using genomic and genetic strategies. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens revealed that mutations in genes from the Hippo, MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways all modulate the cellular response to TEAD inhibition. Inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation strongly reduced YAP/TEAD target expression, whilst only mildly impacting YAP/TEAD genome binding. Additionally, expression of MAPK pathway genes was induced upon inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation, which coincided with YAP/TEAD redistribution to AP-1 transcription factor binding sites. Consistent with this, combined inhibition of TEAD and the MAPK protein MEK, synergistically blocked proliferation of several mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines and more potently reduced the growth of patient-derived lung cancers in vivo. Collectively, we reveal mechanisms by which cells can overcome small-molecule inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation and potential strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of emerging Hippo pathway targeted therapies.",GSE269899,2024/07/08,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset examines mechanisms of resistance to small-molecule inhibitors in lung cancer and discusses therapeutic strategies that could be relevant to immunotherapy.

In experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), Stat4-/- mice are resistant to the development of inflammation and paralysis. Here, we examined cell-type requirements and found that in addition to T cells, STAT4 is required in dendritic cells for development of EAE.

53,200197595,In vivo CRISPR screens identify dual function of MEN1 in regulating tumor-microenvironment interactions,"Functional genomic screen in 2D cell culture is limited in identifying therapeutic targets that modulates tumor-microenvironment interaction. Through comparison of targeted CRISPR-Cas9 screens in 2D cell culture and cell line derived xenografts of lung cancer A549, we identified MEN1 as the top hit that confers differential essentialities in vitro and in vivo. Knockout of MEN1 in multiple solid cancer types does not impact cell proliferation in vitro, but significantly promotes and inhibits tumor growth in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, respectively. Mechanistically, knockout of MEN1 leads to redistribution of its interaction partner MLL1, a histone methyltransferase, to repetitive genomic regions that produce double stranded RNA. This resulted in MARV and cGAS-STING dependent activation of viral mimicry response, which induces tumor promoting neutrophil and tumor suppressing CD8+ T cell infiltrations in immunodeficient and immunocompetent mice, respectively. Consistently, multiple immune cell infiltrations are negatively correlated with MEN1 abundance and positively correlated with that of MLL1 in patient tumors of a broad range of cancer types. Pharmacological inhibition of MEN1-MLL1 interaction reduces tumor growth in CD8+ T cell dependent manner, and synergizes with anti-PD-L1 treatment. These findings reveal tumor microenvironment dependent oncogenic and tumor suppressive function of MEN1 and provide rationale for therapeutic targeting of MEN1 alone or in combination with immunotherapy in multiple solid cancer types.",GSE197595,2024/06/30,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset discusses the role of MEN1 in lung cancer and its interaction with the immune system, highlighting potential therapeutic strategies including immunotherapy.

Previous studies suggest the anti-PD-1 treatment failure may attribute to the intrinsic functions of PD-L1 in cancer cells. Here, we established a genome-wide CRISPR synthetic lethality screen to systematic explore the PD-L1 intrinsic function in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Ferroptosis related genes were identified to be essential for PD-L1 deficient cell viability. Genetic and pharmacological induction of ferroptosis accelerated cell death in PD-L1 knockout cells. PD-L1 knockout cells were also highly susceptible to immunogenic ferroptosis in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, nuclear PD-L1 transcriptionally activated SOD2 expression to maintain redox homeostasis. Importantly, the lower ROS and ferroptosis were observed in HNSCC patients with the higher expression of PD-L1.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from peripheral blood have attracted attention in monitoring therapeutic efficacy. In this study, CTCs were serially collected from patients with HCC undergoing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo+Bev) treatment, and changes in molecular expression and CTC numbers were analyzed to identify effective biomarkers. Approach and results: The peripheral blood samples were collected serially from 22 patients with HCC treated with Atezo+Bev, and CTCs were enriched using RosetteSep. The CD45(-)PanCK(+) cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. RNA extracted from enriched CTCs underwent targeted RNA sequencing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. Changes in CTC numbers during Atezo+Bev treatment reflected the tumor volume. NGS analysis revealed that patients with elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling molecules had a poorer response, whereas those with elevated apoptosis signaling molecules had a favorable response (p < 0.05). In addition, compared with changes in CTC counts, changes in TGF-β signaling molecule expression in CTCs accurately and promptly predicted treatment response. Conclusions: NGS analysis of CTC-derived RNA showed that changes in TGF-β signaling molecules predict treatment response earlier than changes in CTC counts. These findings suggest that changes in the expression of TGF-β molecules in CTCs could serve as novel biomarkers for the early prediction of therapeutic response in patients with unresectable HCC undergoing Atezo+Bev therapy.",GSE261186,2024/07/17,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset pertains to hepatocellular carcinoma and discusses circulating tumor cells, which does not relate to lung cancer or its immunotherapy.

The racial disparity in lung cancer is particularly pronounced in Chicago, a highly segregated urban city. Neighborhood conditions, particularly social stress, may play a role in lung tumorigenesis. Preliminary studies indicate that Black men residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime have significantly higher levels of hair cortisol, an indicator of stress response. To examine the relationship between social stress exposure and gene expression in lung tumors, we investigated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in lung tumor samples in relation to GR target gene expression levels and zip code level residential neighborhood violence. Spatial transcriptomics and a version of ChIP-sequencing known as CUT & RUN were used. GR recruitment to chromatin was correlated with neighborhood violent crime rate and overall GR binding increased with increasing neighborhood violent crime rates. Among patients residing in high-violence neighborhoods, tumor samples, compared to normal neighboring lung tissue, had fewer GR binding sites. The opposite was seen in patients residing in low-violence neighborhoods, with tumor samples having more GR binding sites when compared to normal lung tissue. Tumor samples from patients living in high-violence neighborhoods exhibited increased GR recruitment to genes associated with greater tumor aggressiveness. Our findings suggest that exposure to neighborhood violence may influence tumor biology via reprogramming GR recruitment.

59,200233096,STAT3 inhibition permits epigenetic reprogramming and TLR9/IRF8-driven differentiation of inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia [RNASEQ_AML_DECSCR],"Cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells but achieving leukemic cell immunogenicity proved challenging in clinical setting. Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects.

Unidirectional mitochondrial transfer from T cells to cancer cells was recently observed “metabolically empowering” cancer cells while “depleting immune cells”, providing new insights into Tumor-T cell interaction and immune evasion. Here, we leveraged the increasingly adopted single-cell RNA-seq technology and introduced MERCI, a statistical deconvolution method for tracing and quantifying the process of mitochondrial trafficking between cancer and T cells. MERCI was benchmarked using data generated from a coculture system of MT-labeled cancer and T cells to accurately predict the recipient cells and their mitochondrial compositions. We independently demonstrated the cellular MT transfer signals and validated the MERCI performance by additionally generating a gold-standard mtscATAC-seq dataset. Application of MERCI to single cell human cancer samples identified a novel MT transfer phenotype and its signature genes involved in cytoskeleton remodeling, energy production and TNFα signaling pathways. Application of MERCI to ovarian cancer spatial transcriptomes revealed the prevalence of MT transfer in the tumor tissue of high T cell infiltration, which is elevated in the endothelium-rich regions.

61,200270740,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [A375],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",GSE270740,2024/07/24,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset investigates ceramide metabolism in melanoma and its implications for immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is not directly applicable to lung cancer immunotherapies.

62,200272770,LSD1 inhibition improves efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy by enhancing CD8+ T cell responsiveness,"The lysine-specific histonedemethylase1A(LSD1) has been described to play a role in antitumor immunity; however, the role of LSD1 in shaping CD8+ T cell (CTL) differentiation and function is not understood. Here, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 (LSD1i) in CTL elicited phenotypic and functional alterations of the CTL that led to robust antitumor immunity in the context of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). In addition, the combination of anti-PDL1 therapy with LSD1i-based ACT resulted in a complete tumor eradication and long-lasting tumor-free survival. This study demonstrated that LSD1i together with anti-PDL1 therapy complement each other’s deficiencies and produce a better tumor response in a melanoma model, in which both immune and epigenetic therapy alone have shown limited efficacy. Collectively, these results set the translational potential of modulating LSD1 to improve antitumoral responses generated by ACT and anti-PDL1 therapy, which provide a strong rationale for a combination trial of LSD1i and immunotherapy.",GSE272770,2024/07/23,Not Relevant,3/3,"The dataset discusses LSD1 inhibition in melanoma, which does not directly relate to lung cancer or immunotherapies for lung cancer.

63,200239389,Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 inhibits proliferation and metabolism in non–small cell lung cancer cells in HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manner,"Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-α. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression.",GSE239389,2024/07/17,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset examines the role of PHD2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and discusses potential mechanisms that could be relevant for therapeutic development in lung cancer, aligning with the exploration of immunotherapies.; This dataset examines the role of PHD2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), highlighting its potential impact on tumorigenesis and treatment strategies, making it relevant for exploring immunotherapies for lung cancer.; This dataset investigates the role of PHD2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), suggesting potential mechanisms that could be targeted in lung cancer therapies, making it relevant to immunotherapy exploration in lung cancer."
64,200271247,Sequential redox vulnerabilities with therapeutic potential during the acquisition of drug resistance in BRAFV600E lung adenocarcinoma,"The current targeted therapy for lung cancer patients harbouring BRAFV600E alterations consists of a dual blockade of RAF and MEK kinases often combining dabrafenib with trametinib (D/T). This regimen results in extended survival when compared to single agent treatments but, as with other targeted therapies, disease progression is unavoidable. There is limited information of how BRAFV600E-driven lung adenocarcinomas adapt to this targeted treatment and persist before clinical relapse is detected. At this point, a significant fraction of these resistant tumours display mutations in other members of the RAS-ERK pathway and counteract the inhibitors effect by reactivating oncogenic signalling. We demonstrate here that oxidative stress together with the concomitant induction of antioxidant responses is a prominent and early feature boosted by D/T treatment. However, the nature of the oxidative damage and the choice of redox detoxification systems elicited by cancer cells display substantial differences during the process leading to the onset of drug resistance. While persister cells suffer from lipid peroxidation and strongly rely on GPX4 to prevent ferroptosis-driven cell death, D/T resistant tumours harbouring NRAS secondary mutations enhance cystine transport to boost antioxidant responses. Accordingly, timely inhibition of these detox programs by GPX4 or HDAC inhibitors decrease resistant cell viability and extend therapeutic efficacy.",GSE271247,2024/07/02,Relevant,3/3,"The dataset focuses on drug resistance mechanisms in BRAFV600E lung adenocarcinoma and explores therapeutic implications, making it relevant to the study of lung cancer treatments, including immunotherapies.; This dataset describes the mechanisms of drug resistance in BRAFV600E lung adenocarcinoma, which is crucial for understanding treatment challenges and developing effective immunotherapies.; This dataset studies drug resistance in BRAFV600E lung adenocarcinoma and explores treatment strategies, which can be particularly relevant for understanding and improving lung cancer therapies, including immunotherapies."
65,200245807,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [scRNA-Seq],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments. The HMGA1 effects of gene expression go beyond senescence and appear to be relevant in other contexts, such as lung cancer.",GSE245807,2024/07/08,Relevant,2/3,"This dataset discusses HMGA1's role in chromatin architecture changes related to lung cancer, which could influence tumor behavior and response to therapies, including immunotherapy.; This study implicates HMGA1 in chromatin architecture and gene expression in lung cancer, suggesting potential roles in tumor biology and immunotherapy.; This study focuses on chromatin architecture changes related to HMGA1 and does not specifically address immunotherapy or lung cancer treatment modalities.

66,200244465,The Prostacyclin Receptor is a Nrf2-regulated Immune Checkpoint in CD8+ T cells,"Understanding how circulating metabolites enforce pathways in dysfunctional immune cells may illuminate modes of intervention directed at reviving immune function. The NRF2 pathway is the most widely documented cytoprotective axis in land-dwelling eukaryotes. However, the role of this pathway in CD8+ T cells—which seek and destroy tumors and pathogen infected cells—has yet to be elucidated. Our lab has conducted a RNAseq meta-analysis of CD8+ T cells upon tumor, viral and bacterial inoculation. Curiously, the NRF2 pathway was robustly upregulated in dysfunctional CD8+T cells. To further investigate the role of NRF2 in these contexts we developed a mouse model whereby the NRF2 axis is permanently hyperactivated in CD8+ T cells, hereafter referred to as NRF2Hi. Our in vivo data demonstrate that NRF2Hi CD8+ T cells offer little overall cytoprotection and poorly control tumors and pathogens versus wildtype (WT) control CD8+ T cells. To understand why upregulation of the NRF2 axis could be unfavorable to CD8+ T cell function we conducted RNAseq on NRF2Hi versus WT cells upon viral infection of mice. We found that NRF2Hi cells massively upregulate the prostacyclin receptor (PTGIR), which binds to prostacyclin—a circulating metabolite of arachidonic acid that has only been investigated in vasodilation and is seemingly benign to CD8+ T cells. To decipher the role of PTGIR in CD8+ T cells, we silenced its expression and observed a revival of CD8+ T cell function, significantly reducing tumor and pathogen burden. Collectively, our data illuminate a NRF2-regulated immune checkpoint, PTGIR. Interventions that suppress the interaction between PTGIR and prostacyclin may serve therapeutic benefit in clinical contexts such as cancer and chronic pathogen infections.",GSE244465,2024/07/17,Not Relevant,3/3,"While it discusses immunotherapy in the context of T cells, the focus is on CD8+ T cells and their dysfunction, which is not specific to lung cancer immunotherapy development.; This dataset focuses on the Nrf2 pathway in CD8+ T cells and its implications in broader immune contexts, but does not specifically target lung cancer or relevant immunotherapeutic approaches.; This dataset investigates the role of NRF2 in CD8+ T cells but does not specifically connect to lung cancer immunotherapies.

68,200268242,Anti-tumor Efficacy of HRS-4642 and Its Potential Combination with Proteasome Inhibition in KRAS G12D-mutant Cancer [CRISPR],"KRAS G12D is the most frequently mutated oncogenic KRAS subtype in solid tumors and remains undruggable in clinical settings. Here, we developed a high affinity, selective, long-acting, and non-covalent KRAS G12D inhibitor, HRS-4642, with an affinity constant of 0.083 nM. HRS-4642 demonstrats robust efficacy against KRAS G12D-mutant cancers both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in a phase 1 clinical trial, HRS-4642 exhibits promising anti-tumor activity in the escalating dosing cohorts. Furthermore, the sensitization and resistance spectrum for HRS-4642 was deciphered through genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening, which unveiled the proteasome as a synergistic target. We further observed that the proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, prominently improved the anti-tumor efficacy of HRS-4642. Additionally, HRS-4642, especially when combined with carfilzomib, significantly reshapes the tumor microenvironment towards an immune permissive one.

69,200271698,B cell-intrinsic IFN-g promotes CD11c+ age-associated B cell differentiation and compromises affinity-based germinal center selection in lupus,"Lupus patients respond less efficiently to vaccinations and are more susceptible to infections. Previously, we have shown, in lupus models, that excessive CD11c+ age-associated B cells (ABCs) not only contribute to autoantibody production but also compromise antigen-specific germinal center (GC) B cell selection and affinity maturation by promoting aberrant T cell activation. Yet, how CD11c+ ABC differentiation is regulated is not fully understood. Here we show that B cell-intrinsic IFN-γ is required for excessive CD11c+ ABC differentiation in lupus mice. B cell-intrinsic IFN-γ is mainly produced by CD11c+ ABCs. IFN-γ-deficiency leads to decreased expression of ABC characteristic genes, including Zeb2, an ABC-specific transcription factor recently described. We further show that ablating IFN-γ can normalize T cell overactivation and rescue antigen-specific GC responses in lupus mice.

Here we characterize a phosphorylation site at Ser325 situated C-terminal to the catalytic domain of PTPN22, and its roles in altering protein function. Signaling through the major TCR-dependent pathway under PTPN22 control was enhanced by CRISPR/Cas9 mediated suppression of Ser325 phosphorylation and inhibited by mimicking it via glutamic acid substitution.

However, development of new vaccines against difficult-to-target diseases is hampered by the lack of diverse adjuvants for human use. Of particular interest, none of the currently available adjuvants induce Th17 cells. Here, we develop and test an improved liposomal adjuvant, termed CAF®10b, that incorporates a TLR-9 agonist. In a head-to-head study in non-human primates (NHPs), immunization with antigen adjuvanted with CAF®10b induced significantly increased antibody and cellular immune responses compared to previous CAF® adjuvants, already in clinical trials. This was not seen in the mouse model, demonstrating that adjuvant effects can be highly species specific. Importantly, intramuscular immunization of NHPs with CAF®10b induced robust Th17 responses that were observed in circulation half a year after vaccination. Furthermore, subsequent instillation of unadjuvanted antigen into the skin and lungs of these memory animals led to significant recall responses including transient local lung inflammation observed by Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT), elevated antibody titers, and expanded systemic and local Th1 and Th17 responses, including >20% antigen-specific T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage.

Here, we first report that KRAS mutation in LUAD cells up-regulates the expression of protease 3 (PRTN3), that inhibits cytotoxic immune cell activation in the tumor microenvironment by inhibiting the CXCL9/CXCR3 axis, providing an unconventional mechanism for tumor immune escape. Further mechanism studies demonstrated that PRTN3 was up-regulated by c-Myc transcription and secreted into the tumor microenvironment, where CXCL9 was inactivated by proteolysis, and finally result in inhibiting the activation of natural killer (NK) and CD8+ T cells. Meanwhile, samples from LUAD patients with high PRTN3 expression showed low CXCL9 activity. Furthermore, application of a hydrolysis-resistant CXCL9 protein (H-R CXCL9) effectively improves the immunomodulate effect in LUAD patient organoids.

77,200245246,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3994_ATAC],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",GSE245246,2024/07/01,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset discusses ferroptosis and its regulators without direct ties to lung cancer or its immunotherapy.; This study on ferroptosis and its regulators does not focus specifically on lung cancer or its immunotherapy.; While this dataset discusses ferroptosis and cancer, it does not directly relate to lung cancer or specific immunotherapy applications."
78,200253318,Transcriptional profiling and multiple machine learning methods identified novel microglia biomarkers for Experimental Autoimmune Encephalomyelitis,"Background: Microglia plays complex and crucial roles in multiple sclerosis (MS). This study aimed to explore the biological significance of microglia-associated genes in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) . Methods: Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were screened with six machine learning (ML) methods, which were also utilized to validate the microglia-associated DEGs in three public databases. ceRNA and Protein–protein interaction (PPI) network analyses were utilized to identify the interaction of the 6 novel biomarkers with other molecules. Then, CIBERSORT and single-sample gene set enrichment analysis (ssGSEA) were employed to quantify the relative abundance of each immune cell infiltration, respectively. qRT-PCR was performed to test the expression of key DEGs in murine models. Results: A total of 247 DEmRNA, 499 DElncRNAs and 269 DEcircRNAs were identified. With screening strategy of five ML algorithms, 6 DEmRNAs were obtained including NGP, HIST1H2BJ, PBLD1, MBLN3, CD180 and F10. Then the 6 DEmRNAs were used as a multigene signature to construct models to differentiate EAE from normal microglia, and AUC value for each model was greater than 0.8. The diagnostic value of these 6 DEmRNAs were identified and further verified by qRT-PCR. Then, differential expression for five out of these 6 DEmRNAs, namely NGP, HIST1H2BJ, PBLD1, MBLN3, and F10 were confirmed. Using PPI analysis, DEmRNAs frequently interacting with transcription factors (TFs), potential drugs and RBPs were identified. With immune cell infiltration analyses, we found EAE microglia presented high levels of immune infiltration, especially Nature Killer (NK) cells and CD8+ T cells.

80,200236720,Synthetic essentiality of thymine DNA glycosylase in p53-deficient cancer [RNA-seq],"Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) is a versatile protein involved in DNA mismatch repair, DNA demethylation, and transcriptional regulation. Here, we identify TDG as a synthetic essential effector in p53-deficient tumours. We found that deletion of TDG inhibits cell proliferation specifically in p53-deficient cancer cells. Using a genetically engineered mouse model of lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD), we demonstrate that depletion of TDG suppresses tumour growth in the p53-deficient context. Notably, A novel and selective inhibitor developed to disrupt the DNA binding activity of TDG exhibits therapeutic efficacy against p53-deficient tumours in both cellular and xenograft models. Mechanistically, TDG coordinates with p53 to orchestrate the transcription of RNA helicase DHX9, which functions to eliminate dsRNA. Depletion of TDG in p53-deficient cells results in the downregulation of DHX9 and aberrant cytoplasmic double-strand (dsRNA) accumulation derived from Alu elements, subsequently activating the RIG-I/MDA5-MAVS mediated antiviral response. Moreover, single-cell RNA-sequencing analysis revealed the depletion of TDG in p53-deficient tumours facilitates the recruitment of tumour-infiltrating lymphocytes. We observed that TDG inhibition combined with immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) achieved a strong synergistic anti-tumour effect in p53-deficient tumours. This study highlights the function of TDG in maintaining p53-deficient tumour growth and provides an alternative therapeutic target for p53-deficient cancers.",GSE236720,2024/06/21,Not Relevant,2/3,"This dataset explores the role of thymine DNA glycosylase in p53-deficient lung cancer, illustrating its importance in tumor growth and immune response.

81,200271371,Differential tumor immune microenvironment coupled with tumor progression or tumor eradication in HPV-antigen expressing squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) models.,"Human papilloma virus (HPV) is an etiological factor of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC). To investigate the role of HPV antigen in anti-tumor immunity, we established mouse models by expressing HPV16 E6 and E7 in a SCC tumor cell line. We obtained two HPV antigen-expressing clones (C-225 and C-100) transplantable into C57BL/6 recipients. We found that C-225 elicited complete eradication in C57BL/6 mice (eradicated), whereas C-100 grew progressively (growing). We examined immune tumor microenvironment (TME) using flow cytometry and found that eradicated or growing tumors exhibited differential immune profiles that may influence the outcome of anti-tumor immunity. Surprisingly, the percentage of CD8 and CD4 tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) was much higher in growing (C-100) than eradicated (C-225) tumor. However, the TILs upregulated PD-1 and LAG-3 more potently and exhibited impaired effector functions in growing tumor compared to their counterparts in eradicated tumor. C-225 TME is highly enriched with myeloid cells, especially polymorphonuclear (PMN) myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSC), whereas the percentage of M-MDSC and tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs) was much higher in C-100 TME, especially M2-TAMs (CD206+). The complete eradication of C-225 depended on CD8 T cells and elicited anti-tumor memory responses upon secondary tumor challenge. We employed DNA sequencing to identify differences in the T cell receptor of peripheral blood lymphocytes pre- and post-secondary tumor challenge. Lastly, C-225 and C-100 tumor lines harbored different somatic mutations. Overall, we uncovered differential immune TME that may underlie the divergent outcomes of anti-tumor immunity by establishing two SCC tumor lines, both of which express HPV16 E6 and E7 antigens. Our experimental models may provide a platform for pinpointing tumor-intrinsic versus host-intrinsic differences in orchestrating an immunosuppressive TME in HNSCCs and for identifying new targets that render tumor cells vulnerable to immune attack.",GSE271371,2024/07/09,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset focuses on squamous cell carcinoma related to HPV, which is not directly linked to lung cancer immunotherapies.

82,200235391,Monoclonal antibodies targeting PCDH7 inhibit tumor growth and enhance targeted therapy response in non-small cell lung cancer,"We identified a critical oncogenic role for Protocadherin 7 (PCDH7), a cell surface protein and member of the Cadherin superfamily in NSCLC. PCDH7 is frequently overexpressed in lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) and associates with poor clinical outcome. Depletion of Pcdh7 reduces lung tumor burden and prolongs survival in mouse models of high-grade NSCLC, demonstrating that this protein is an actionable therapeutic target. Here we report the development and characterization of high affinity anti-PCDH7 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) that inhibit downstream MAPK pathway activation and suppress tumor growth in multiple mouse models, including KRAS- and EGFR-mutant models. A lead mAb (mAb7) sensitized tumors to the FDA-approved MEK inhibitor trametinib. Moreover, the humanized mAb7-IgG1 exhibited antibody dependent cellular cytotoxicity (ADCC) and Fc-mediated immune effector killing of tumor cells in vivo.

83,200245245,CRISPR activation screens identify the SWI-SNF ATPases as suppressors of ferroptosis [NGS3991_RNA],"Ferroptosis is an iron-dependent cell death mechanism characterized by an accumulation of toxic lipid peroxides and membrane rupture. The glutathione dependent enzyme, GPX4 (glutathione peroxidase 4), prevents ferroptosis by reducing these lipid peroxides into non-toxic lipid alcohols. Ferroptosis induction by GPX4 inhibition has emerged as a vulnerability of cancer cells, thus highlighting the need to identify ferroptosis regulators that may be exploited therapeutically. Through genome-wide screens and a series of genetic, genomic, and quantitative imaging approaches, we identify the SWI-SNF ATPases BRM and BRG1 as ferroptosis suppressors. Mechanistically, they directly bind to and catalytically increase chromatin accessibility at NRF2 target loci, thus boosting NRF2 transcriptional output. This primes cells to counter lipid peroxidation and confers resistance to GPX4 inhibition and ferroptosis. Importantly, we demonstrate that the BRM/BRG1-ferroptosis connection can be leveraged to enhance the paralog dependency of BRG1-mutant lung cancer cells on BRM, especially in lines that are less sensitive to BRM inhibition or degradation. Our data reveal ferroptosis induction as a potential avenue for broadening the efficacy of BRM degraders/inhibitors and define a specific genetic context for exploiting GPX4 dependency.",GSE245245,2024/07/01,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset focuses on the regulation of ferroptosis in cancer cells, which may not be directly tied to immunotherapy strategies for lung cancer.

84,200268049,The effect of exposure to neighborhood violence on GR signaling in lung tumors [Spatial Transcriptomics],"Despite lower rates and intensity of smoking, Black men experience a higher incidence of lung cancer compared to White men. The racial disparity in lung cancer is particularly pronounced in Chicago, a highly segregated urban city. Neighborhood conditions, particularly social stress, may play a role in lung tumorigenesis. Preliminary studies indicate that Black men residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime have significantly higher levels of hair cortisol, an indicator of stress response. To examine the relationship between social stress exposure and gene expression in lung tumors, we investigated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in lung tumor samples in relation to GR target gene expression levels and zip code level residential neighborhood violence. Spatial transcriptomics and a version of ChIP-sequencing known as CUT & RUN were used. GR recruitment to chromatin was correlated with neighborhood violent crime rate and overall GR binding increased with increasing neighborhood violent crime rates. Among patients residing in high-violence neighborhoods, tumor samples, compared to normal neighboring lung tissue, had fewer GR binding sites. The opposite was seen in patients residing in low-violence neighborhoods, with tumor samples having more GR binding sites when compared to normal lung tissue. Tumor samples from patients living in high-violence neighborhoods exhibited increased GR recruitment to genes associated with greater tumor aggressiveness. Our findings suggest that exposure to neighborhood violence may influence tumor biology via reprogramming GR recruitment. Prioritizing lung cancer screening in neighborhoods with increased social stress, such as high violence, may reduce racial disparities in lung cancer.",GSE268049,2024/07/10,Relevant,2/3,"This dataset examines the effects of neighborhood violence on glucocorticoid receptor signaling in lung tumors, suggesting social stress influences tumor biology.

85,200226471,ICOS-expressing Treg cells influence the composition of anti-tumor CTL population,"The role of ICOS in anti-tumor T cell responses and overall tumor progression has been controversial. Here, we compared tumor progression in mice lacking ICOS only in Treg cells or in all T cells. We found that Treg-specific ICOS knockout reduces the overall tumor burden compared to Cre control mice with increased T effector/Treg ratios in the tumor. In contrast, there was no difference in the tumor burden in mice lacking ICOS in all the T cell compartments. This suggests a dual role of ICOS costimulation in promoting pro- and anti-tumor T cell responses. Consistent with reduced tumor burden, we found that Treg-specific deletion of ICOS leads to an increase of CD8+ CTLs that express high levels of granzyme B and perforin. Moreover, single-cell transcriptome analysis revealed an increase of Ly108hiEomeshi CD8+ T cell subset at the cost of Ly108hiT-bethi subset in Treg-specific knockout mice. These results suggest that ICOS-expressing Treg cells suppress CTL maturation process at the level of Eomes upregulation, a critical step known to drive perforin expression and cytotoxicity. Collectively, our data imply that cancer immunotherapies using ICOS agonist antibodies would work better in Treg-low tumors or when they are combined with regimens that deplete tumor-infiltrating Treg cells.",GSE226471,2024/07/18,Relevant,2/3,"This dataset provides insights into the role of ICOS-expressing Treg cells in anti-tumor immunity, which is crucial for designing effective immunotherapies.

86,200245804,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [Hi-C],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments. The HMGA1 effects of gene expression go beyond senescence and appear to be relevant in other contexts, such as lung cancer.",GSE245804,2024/07/08,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset focuses on HMGA1's role in chromatin architecture and transcriptional changes, which may not directly relate to immunotherapy strategies for lung cancer.

Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1.

Previous studies suggest the anti-PD-1 treatment failure may attribute to the intrinsic functions of PD-L1 in cancer cells. Here, we established a genome-wide CRISPR synthetic lethality screen to systematic explore the PD-L1 intrinsic function in head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) cells. Ferroptosis related genes were identified to be essential for PD-L1 deficient cell viability. Genetic and pharmacological induction of ferroptosis accelerated cell death in PD-L1 knockout cells.
