The clean reads were then mapped to a reference genome (GRCh38, GENCODE Ensembl 104 annotation) using the STAR aligner (v2.7.9a). Aligned BAM files were subsequently collected as input to the counting tool HTSeq-count (v0.11.0) to obtain the read count per gene per sample, then merged into a count matrix for differential analysis.
