Using the human index as the dataset concerns lung cancer in humans. Fastq1 and Fastq2 are selected as they pair directly for transcripts being quantified. The output directory is named to reflect the identifiers of the processed samples to aid organization. Bootstraps are set to 100 for robust error estimation. Non-single-end reads imply setting single to false. Strand specificity is anticipated based on typical RNA-Seq protocols, and a paired-end approach typically suggests fr stranded reads. Fragment length and standard deviation are estimated based on the average length of 300 bp for common RNA-Seq protocols.
