The pathology of IPF starts in the lung bases such that a patient’s lung apices are comparatively less fibrotic at the time of transplantation. We hypothesized that RNA sequencing of the lung apices and bases may identify differentially expressed genes that better reflect disease progression in IPF. Samples were derived from both right and left lungs when available and RNA Seq was performed on a total of 139 samples.\n",

Although scRNA-Seq has emerged as a powerful technique for characterizing cellular heterogeneity, it is currently impractical for large sample cohorts and cannot be applied to fixed specimens collected as part of routine clinical care. To overcome these challenges, we extended Cell type Identification By Estimating Relative Subsets Of RNA Transcripts (CIBERSORT) into a new platform for in silico cytometry. Our approach enables the simultaneous inference of cell type abundance and cell type-specific gene expression profiles (GEPs) from bulk tissue transcriptomes. The utility of this integrated framework, called CIBERSORTx, is demonstrated in multiple tumor types, including melanoma, where single cell reference profiles are used to dissect primary clinical specimens, revealing cell type-specific signatures of driver mutations and immunotherapy response. We anticipate that digital cytometry will augment single cell profiling efforts, enabling cost-effective, high throughput tissue characterization without the need for antibodies, disaggregation, or viable cells.\n",

While the molecular basis for this heterogeneity remains uncharacterized, single-cell technologies allow us to explore the transcriptional states within tissues at an unprecedented resolution which could further understanding of these complex diseases. Here, we apply single-cell RNA-sequencing to human inflamed intestine and show that the largest differences among patients are present within the myeloid compartment including macrophages and neutrophils. Using spatial transcriptomics in human tissue at single-cell resolution (CosMx Spatial Molecular Imaging) we spatially localized each of the macrophage and neutrophil subsets identified by single-cell RNA-sequencing and unravel further macrophage diversity based on their tissue localization. Finally, single-cell RNA-sequencing combined with single-cell spatial analysis reveals a strong communication network involving macrophages and inflammatory fibroblasts. Our data sheds light on the cellular complexity of these diseases and points towards the myeloid and stromal compartments as important cellular subsets for understanding patient-to-patient heterogeneity.\n",

    "- During activation, T cells integrate multiple signals from APCs and cytokine milieu. The blockade of these signals can have clinical benefits as exemplified by CTLA4-Ig, which blocks interaction of B7 co-stimulatory molecules on APCs with CD28 on T cells. Variants of CTLA4-Ig, abatacept and belatacept are FDA approved as immunosuppressive agents in arthritis and transplantation whereas murine studies suggested that CTLA4-Ig can be beneficial in a number of other diseases. However, detailed analysis of human CD4 cell hyporesponsivness induced by CTLA4-Ig has not been performed. Herein, we established a model to study effect of CTLA4-Ig on the activation of human naïve T cells in a human mixed lymphocytes system. Comparison of human CD4 cells activated in the presence or absence of CTLA4-Ig, showed that co-stimulation blockade during TCR activation does not affect NFAT signaling but results in decreased activation of NF-kB and AP-1 transcription factors followed by profound decrease in proliferation and cytokine production. The resulting T cells become hyporesponsive to secondary activation and, although capable of receiving TCR signals, fail to proliferate or produce cytokines, demonstrating properties of anergic cells. However, unlike some models of T cell anergy, these cells did not possess increased levels of TCR signaling inhibitor CBLB. Rather, the CTLA4-Ig induced hyporesponsiveness was associated with an elevated level of p27kip1 cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor.\n",

Genetic effects on gene regulation in these data show clear temporal structure. We identified hundreds of dynamic eQTLs that change significantly over time, with enrichment in enhancers of relevant cell types.

    "- Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental condition with a strong genetic link, but no single well-established cause. This suggests that perturbed regulatory network may better explain its heterogeneity of phenotypes and multiple gene associations. Consistently, our previous study provided evidence of abnormal alternative polyadenylation in transcripts from distinct brain regions suggesting a potential imbalance in the protein synthesis in the postsynaptic density. To test this hypothesis, we studied transcriptome-wide alterations of mRNA translation in post-mortem brain samples from neurotypical and ASD-affected young males subjects. To this end, we employed an optimised polysome profiling technique amendable for small tissue samples and analyzed changes in the translatome using the anota2seq algorithm. The analysis revealed bolstered translation of mRNAs whose translational efficiency was previously reported to be sensitive to eIF4E, a key factor for synaptic protein synthesis modulated by Ras/ERK and PI3K/mTOR signaling pathways. This observation is consistent with previous findings linking hyperactive eIF4E to increased translation of neuroligins, a disturbed excitation/inhibition ratio in synapses and autistic-like phenotypes in mice. In summary, we reveal a link between eIF4E-dependent translation and human autism, indicating a potential pharmacy-therapeutical target for the prevention of behavioral impairments in ASD.\n",

DGE analysis was done using “pipeline-transcriptome-de” (https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-transcriptome-de) pipeline. DGE analysis confirmed that upregulation of ANK pathway was evident at 6 months in the Mw group. Apart from upregulation of KLRC2 and B3GAT1 and downregulation of KLRC1, the key transcription factor in the ANK pathway, BCL11b, was persistently upregulated. Downregulation of EAT-2 and PLZF further corroborated the classic gene expression signature of ANK cells. Moreover, increased expression of AT-rich interaction domain 5B (ARID5B), as demonstrated in the Mw group plays an important role in enhanced metabolism in ANK cells as well as increased IFN-γ release and survival. DGE analysis also revealed an enhancement of ANK mediated ADCC pathway, with significant upregulation of CD247 along with downregulation of FCER1G, which is a typical signature of ANK-ADCC. Both CD247 and FCER1G are adapter molecules for FCGRIIIA (CD16) with CD247 possessing 3 ITAMs against one ITAM of FCER1G, increasing the ADCC several folds.

    "- 26 samples\n",
    "- Loss of function mutations in MECP2are associated to Rett syndrome (RTT), a severe neurodevelopmental disease. Mainly working as a transcriptional regulator, MECP2 absence leads to gene expression perturbations resulting in deficits of synaptic function and neuronal activity. In addition, RTT patients and mouse models suffer from a complex metabolic syndrome, suggesting that related cellular pathways might contribute to neuropathogenesis. Along this line, autophagy is critical in sustaining developing neuron homeostasis by breaking down dysfunctional proteins, lipids, and organelles. Here, we investigated the autophagic pathway in RTT and found reduced content of autophagic vacuoles in Mecp2 knock-out neurons. This correlates with defective lipidation of LC3B-II probably caused by a deficiency of the autophagic membrane lipid phosphatidylethanolamine. The administration of the autophagy inducer trehalose recovers LC3B lipidation, autophagosomes content in knock-out neurons, and ameliorates their morphology, neuronal activity and synaptic ultrastructure. Moreover, we provide evidence for attenuation of motor and exploratory impairment in Mecp2 knock-out mice upon trehalose administration.

Currently, there are no approved treatments that address the underlying genetic cause of this disease, representing a significant unmet need. Mutations in Plakophilin-2 (PKP2), encoding a desmosomal protein, account for approximately 40% of ARVC cases and result in reduced gene expression. Methods: Our goal is to examine the feasibility and the efficacy of adeno-associated virus 9 (AAV9)-mediated restoration of PKP2 expression in a cardiac specific knock-out mouse model of Pkp2. Results: We show that a single dose of AAV9:PKP2 gene delivery prevents disease development before the onset of cardiomyopathy and attenuates disease progression after overt cardiomyopathy. Restoration of PKP2 expression leads to a significant extension of lifespan by restoring cellular structures of desmosomes and gap junctions, preventing or halting decline in left ventricular ejection fraction, preventing or reversing dilation of the right ventricle, ameliorating ventricular arrhythmia event frequency and severity, and preventing adverse fibrotic remodeling. RNA sequencing analyses show that restoration of PKP2 expression leads to highly coordinated and durable correction of PKP2-associated transcriptional networks beyond desmosomes, revealing a broad spectrum of biological perturbances behind ARVC disease etiology. Conclusions: We identify fundamental mechanisms of PKP2-associated ARVC beyond disruption of desmosome function.

From a series of CRC patients who received ACHT, two stage III extreme cohorts (unfavorable vs. favorable prognosis) were selected. RNA sequencing was performed from fresh frozen explants. Tumors were characterized for somatic mutations. Validation was performed in stage III CRC patients extracted from two GEO datasets. According to disease free survival (DFS), 108 differentially expressed genes (104/4 up/downregulated in the unfavorable prognosis group) were identified. Among 104 upregulated genes, 42 belonged to olfactory signaling pathways, 62 were classified as pseudogenes (n = 17), uncharacterized noncoding RNA (n = 10), immune response genes (n = 4), microRNA (n = 1), cancer-related genes (n = 14) and cancer-unrelated genes (n = 16). Three out of four down-regulated genes were cancer-related. Mutational status (i.e., RAS, BRAF, PIK3CA) did not differ among the cohorts. In the validation cohort, multivariate analysis showed high PNN and KCNQ1OT1 expression predictive of shorter DFS in ACHT treated patients (p = 0.018 and p = 0.014, respectively); no difference was observed in untreated patients. This is the first study that identifies by a transcriptomic approach and validates PNN and KCNQ1OT1 as molecular biomarkers predictive of chemotherapy response in stage III CRC patients. After a further validation in an independent cohort, PNN and KCNQ1OT1 evaluation could be proposed to prospectively identify stage III CRC patients benefiting from ACHT.\n",

    "- 74 samples\n",
    "- Transcriptomic analyses from early human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection have the potential to reveal how HIV causes widespread and lasting damage to biological functions, especially in the immune system. Previous studies have been hampered by difficulties in obtaining early specimens. We studied 29 HIV infected subjects 1 month from presentation and 46 contemporaneous uninfected controls. We used RNA-seq to examine circulating immune cells to describe in detail the profound gene dysregulation observed in early HIV infection. Correlations were sought between viral load and differential gene expression, and biological implications were examined. The most profoundly upregulated biological functions related to cell cycle regulation, DNA repair and replication, microtubule and spindle organization, and immune activation and response. Our findings provide insight into the pathogenic mechanisms of early HIV-induced immune damage, information important for timely interventions to prevent clinical progression, inhibit reservoir seeding, and enable vaccine development.\n",

    "- 63 samples, multiple tissues\n",
    "- Gene expression changes during ageing were shown to oppose developmental trajectories; a reversal pattern previously linked to cellular identity loss. Generating cortex, lung, liver and muscle tissue transcriptomes of 16 mice of different ages, covering development and ageing periods, we found that expression reversals were widespread but tissue-specific. Consistent with this result, we observed an inter-tissue divergence during development and convergence during ageing (DiCo), further confirmed in independent mouse and human datasets. The genes displaying DiCo pattern were enriched among tissue-specific genes that tended to lose developmental expression levels during ageing. Finally, analysing publicly available single-cell transcriptome data, we studied the contribution of cellular composition and cell-autonomous changes to the convergence in ageing. Our results, for the first time, suggest inter-tissue convergence during ageing is widespread and associated with the loss of specialisation at the tissue and possibly also at the cellular level.\n",

    "- 139 samples, multiple tissues\n",
    "- Variation in the expression level and activity of genes involved in drug disposition and action (“pharmacogenes”) can affect drug response and toxicity, especially when in tissues of pharmacological importance. Previous studies have relied primarily on microarrays to understand gene expression differences, or have focused on a single tissue or small number of samples. The goal of this study was to use RNA-seq to determine the expression levels and alternative splicing of 389 PGRN pharmacogenes across four tissues (liver, kidney, heart and adipose) and lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), which are used widely in pharmacogenomics studies. Analysis of RNA-seq data from different individuals across the 5 tissues (N = 139 samples) revealed substantial variation in both expression levels and splicing across samples and tissue types. This in-depth exploration also revealed 183 splicing events in pharmacogenes that were previously not annotated. Overall, this study serves as a rich resource for the research community to inform biomarker and drug discovery and use.\n",

    "## GSE252291 - Meningioma transcriptomic landscape demonstrates novel subtypes with regional associated biology and patient outcome (2024)\n",
    "- Meningiomas are the most common primary intracranial tumors in humans. While most of these tumors are benign, some are malignant, rapidly recur after multimodal treatment with surgery and radiotherapy, and can ultimately be fatal. The current WHO grade system does not always identify high risk meningiomas, therefore better characterizations of the biology of aggressive tumors are needed. In order to address these challenges, we combined 13 bulk RNA-Seq datasets, corrected for batch effects, and applied Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP) to create a reference landscape of ~1300 meningioma tumors. Our analyses revealed multiple distinct meningioma subtypes with specific biological signatures. Clinical metadata, mutations, copy number alterations, and gene-fusion data effectively correlated with regions of the UMAP. Notably, regional distribution of time to recurrence identified major clusters as well as intra-cluster differences of meningiomas with varying patient outcomes. The most aggressive subtype, characterized by an enrichment of higher WHO grades, frequent tumor recurrences, and shorter time to recurrence, exhibited elevated proliferation rates and RNA expression resembling muscle development. To facilitate clinical applications, we developed a cross-validated nearest-neighbors-based algorithm that accurately maps new patients onto this UMAP landscape. Our study highlights the utility of transcriptomic analysis in discerning meningioma heterogeneity as well as successful combination of multiple datasets from various sources. We provide a valuable tool for understanding the disease, predicting tumor biology and patient prognosis. This resource is accessible via the open source, interactive online tool Oncoscape, where the scientific community can explore the landscape and mine clinical and genomic metadata.\n",
    "- We collected meningioma tumor samples, extracted total RNA and sequenced. Then we combined the in-house sequenced dataset with other publicly available meningioma RNA-Seq datasets that we collected to generate a UMAP. Clinical and genomic metadata was overlaid on to the UMAP and meningioma subtypes were analyzed.\n",

    "- An initial comparison of RNA-sequencing datasets from 251 experiments on 35 human intestinal organoid lines revealed that differences in transcriptional signatures could be influenced by variations in the format (3D, monolayers on transwells, and monolayers on 96-well plates) as well as substrate (collagen and Matrigel) in which the organoid lines are cultured. While the organoid lines were a common to these datasets, there were differences in experimental approaches in different laboratories. To rule out potential confounding variables, we performed an RNA-Seq experiment using 5 jejunal organoid lines cultured at the same time in different formats and substrates to evaluate their roles in baseline transcriptional signatures and determine if key findings from the initial analysis could be validated.\n",
    "- 25 samples were analyzed (no technical replicates). The cell lines used were J2,J3, J4, J6, J11. Each of these cell lines were plated as follows: 3D on Matrigel; Transwells on Matrigel; Transwells on collagen; Monolayers on Matrigel; Monolayers on collagen"
