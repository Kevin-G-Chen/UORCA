    "- How well does it handle inputs/outputs?\n",
    "- How well will it handle the METADATA?\n",
    "- How much guidance do I need to give? e.g. with the libraries that are available (in theory, I'd like this to be a \"step\" that the LLM is smart enough to know to implement). I don't want to have the LLM install new packages, that feels like a security risk.\n",

      "Certainly! To analyze RNA-Seq data obtained from Kallisto and identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using R, you will typically follow these steps:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Load the necessary libraries**: You will need libraries like `tximport` for importing Kallisto data, `DESeq2` for differential expression analysis, and `tidyverse` for data manipulation and visualization.\n",

      "2. **Import the abundance data**: Use `tximport` to import the abundance files from Kallisto.\n",

      "\n",
      "4. **Run the differential expression analysis**: Use DESeq2 to identify DEGs.\n",
      "\n",

      "   - **Values**: `WT` vs. `GNAS knockout`\n",
      "   - **Justification**: Comparing the wild-type (WT) genotype with the GNAS knockout model can reveal insights into the role of GNAS in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. A differential expression analysis may uncover how gene knockout affects the expression profile, potentially identifying pathways or markers critical in the disease.\n",

      "   - **Values**: `DMSO` vs. `RGFP966 (5 µM)`\n",
      "   - **Justification**: Analyzing the gene expression differences between the DMSO-treated and RGFP966-treated samples allows for the evaluation of RGFP966's effects as a therapeutic agent. Such comparisons can yield important information on its mechanism of action and efficacy in affecting cellular processes in DLBCL.\n",

      "3. **Comparison 3**:\n",
      "   - **Column Name**: `genotype:ch1`\n",
      "   - **Values**: `GNAS knockout` (across treatments with DMSO and RGFP966)\n",
      "   - **Justification**: Investigating the effects of GNAS deletion across both treatment conditions (DMSO vs. RGFP966) can help understand whether the treatment response is dependent on the genetic background. This can provide insights into potential interactions between genotype and treatment effect, guiding personalized approaches in therapy.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Comparison 4**:\n",
      "   - **Column Name**: `treatment:ch1`\n",
      "   - **Values**: `DMSO` in WT vs. `DMSO` in GNAS knockout\n",
      "   - **Justification**: Comparing the effects of DMSO treatment on WT versus GNAS knockout cell lines can shed light on how the baseline genetic variation impacts cellular responses, thus offering insights into the biological roles of GNAS in DLBCL.\n",

      "5. **Comparison 5**:\n",

      "   - **Justification**: This comparison assesses whether the therapeutic effect of RGFP966 is influenced by GNAS status. Understanding this relationship could reveal important information for the development of targeted cancer therapies, especially in cases where GNAS mutations might confer resistance or sensitivity to treatment.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are an expert bioinformatician, who meticulously and carefully plans computational RNAseq experiments. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been asked to evaluate a basic analysis pipeline which can be used to analyse quantification data generated from Kallisto. \n",
    "\n",
    "Take a deep breath, and carefully take note of the steps outlined below to achieve the best possible outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Evaluate each proposed step in the pipeline, taking into consideration\n",
    "a) The accuracy of the proposed code \n",
    "- Assess the general structure of the code, and double check the existence of any proposed functions and libraries, as opposed to specific parameters\n",
    "- Pay special attention to capitalization, correct use of underscores/periods in functions, and whether or not the function exists\n",
    "- There will be placeholder values in the proposed code - do not assess these as incorrect.\n",
    "b) The necessity and value of each step of the code\n",
    "c) The simplicity of each code\n",
    "d) Whether the code follows commonly accepted guidelines\n",
    "2. If possible improvements can be made in any of the above factors, make these suggestions to individual steps\n",
    "3. If there appears to be steps missing, generate additional steps. Mark these additional steps as \"not\" passing the step evaluation.\n",
    "4. If and only if all steps pass the evaluation, mark the overall pipeline as \"Yes\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Where needed, improve the list of sequential steps to perform the RNAseq analysis\n",
    "2. Each step should achieve a single goal\n",
