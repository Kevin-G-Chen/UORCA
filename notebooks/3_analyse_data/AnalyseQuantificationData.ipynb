      "Certainly! Here's a step-by-step guide on how to import Kallisto's `abundance.tsv` files into R and then identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). We'll use the `tximport`, `DESeq2`, and `ggplot2` packages to facilitate this process. \n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Set up your environment\n",
      "\n",
      "First, make sure you have the required packages installed. You can install them using the following command (if you haven't done so already):\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "install.packages(\"BiocManager\")\n",
      "BiocManager::install(c(\"DESeq2\", \"tximport\", \"ggplot2\"))\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Load the libraries\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, load the necessary libraries:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "library(DESeq2)\n",
      "library(tximport)\n",
      "library(ggplot2)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Import Kallisto abundance files\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming you have multiple `abundance.tsv` files from Kallisto, you'll typically have a directory where these files are stored. Each file corresponds to a sample. You'll need to create a data frame with the sample information and the file paths, and then use `tximport` to read the data.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hereâ€™s an example code:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Set the working directory to where your abundance.tsv files are located\n",
      "setwd(\"/path/to/your/kallisto_output\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# List files and filter for abundance.tsv\n",
      "abundance_files <- list.files(pattern = \"abundance.tsv$\", full.names = TRUE)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Create a data frame with sample names and their corresponding file paths\n",
      "sample_names <- gsub(\"/path/to/your/kallisto_output/(.+)/abundance.tsv\", \"\\\\1\", abundance_files)\n",
      "sample_data <- data.frame(sample=sample_names, files=abundance_files)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Check the sample data\n",
      "print(sample_data)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Load your sample information (this should include conditions or groups)\n",
      "# Here we assume you have a data frame with two columns: Sample and Condition\n",
      "# For example:\n",
      "# samples <- data.frame(sample = sample_names, condition = c(\"control\", \"treatment\", ...))\n",
      "\n",
      "# Load tximport\n",
      "txi <- tximport(sample_data$files, type = \"kallisto\", txIn = FALSE, txOut = FALSE)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Check the imported data\n",
      "head(txi$counts)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Create a DESeq2 dataset object\n",
      "\n",
      "You'll now convert the imported data into a DESeq2 dataset:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Create DESeq2 dataset\n",
      "dds <- DESeqDataSetFromTximport(txi, colData = samples, design = ~ condition)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Check the DESeq2 object\n",
      "dds\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Run the differential expression analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, you perform the differential expression analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Run the DESeq function\n",
      "dds <- DESeq(dds)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Retrieve results\n",
      "results <- results(dds)\n",
      "\n",
      "# View the top results\n",
      "head(results[order(results$padj), ])\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 6: Visualize the results\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, you can visualize the results using a volcano plot or a PCA plot:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Volcano plot\n",
      "ggplot(as.data.frame(results), aes(x = log2FoldChange, y = -log10(padj))) +\n",
      "  geom_point() +\n",
      "  theme_minimal() +\n",
      "  labs(title = \"Volcano plot\", x = \"log2 Fold Change\", y = \"-log10 adjusted p-value\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# PCA plot\n",
      "rlog_counts <- rlog(dds)\n",
      "plotPCA(rlog_counts, intgroup = \"condition\")\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Important Notes:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Sample Metadata**: Ensure your `samples` data frame correctly maps your samples to their respective experimental conditions. This is crucial for accurate differential expression analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Quality Control**: It's often helpful to perform quality control checks (like examining the distribution of counts) and normalization before conducting differential expression analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Results Interpretation**: After obtaining results, always interpret the results with caution, considering biological relevance, effect sizes, and the context of your experiment.\n",
      "\n",
      "This code provides a basic pipeline for identifying DEGs using Kallisto `abundance.tsv` files in R. Modify it based on your specific experimental design and requirements!\n"

      "Despite selective HDAC3 inhibition showing promise in a subset of lymphomas with CREBBP mutations, wild-type tumors generally exhibit resistance. Here, using unbiased genome-wide CRISPR screening, we identify GNAS knockout (KO) as a sensitizer of resistant lymphoma cells to HDAC3 inhibition. Mechanistically, GNAS KO-induced sensitization is independent of the canonical G-protein activities but unexpectedly mediated by viral mimicry-related interferon (IFN) responses, characterized by TBK1 and IRF3 activation, double-stranded RNA formation, and transposable element (TE) expression. GNAS KO additionally synergizes with HDAC3 inhibition to enhance CD8+ T cell-induced cytotoxicity. Moreover, we observe in human lymphoma patients that low GNAS expression is associated with high baseline TE expression and upregulated IFN signaling and shares common disrupted biological activities with GNAS KO in histone modification, mRNA processing, and transcriptional regulation. Collectively, our findings establish an unprecedented link between HDAC3 inhibition and viral mimicry in lymphoma. We suggest low GNAS expression as a potential biomarker that reflects viral mimicry priming for enhanced response to HDAC3 inhibition in the clinical treatment of lymphoma, especially the CREBBP wild-type cases.\n"

    "- The original instruction was simply to list the name of the function - this is your main focus, rather than the parameters within the function\n",

    "c) The simplicity of each code\n",
    "d) Whether the code follows commonly accepted guidelines\n",
    "2. If possible improvements can be made in any of the above factors, make these suggestions to individual steps\n",

      "Justification: The provided parameters were chosen after a careful review of the RNAseq analysis pipeline and available dataset metadata. 1. **kallisto_directory**: This points to the correct folder where Kallisto output files are stored, which is essential for importing quantification files. 2. **t2g**: The path to the text-to-gene mapping file is provided to facilitate the mapping of transcripts to genes during quantification file import. 3. **metadata**: The specified metadata path is necessary to load sample information that will be linked to the quantification data. 4. **columns_to_clean**: This maps the original column names to cleaned versions. Based on the metadata, 'genotype:ch1' is cleaned to 'genotype_clean' for consistent naming to avoid any errors during analysis, and 'treatment:ch1' is similarly cleaned to 'treatment_clean'. 5. **filter_group**: Selected 'genotype_clean' as the group column for filtering, as it directly represents distinct experimental conditions for differential expression analysis. 6. **output_directory**: Specified to ensure all generated output files are saved in an organized manner. 7. **geo_sra_mapping**: Supplied for linking GEO accessions to SRA IDs, a critical step for full integration of sampled data. 8. **merge_columns**: Set to NULL because there are no additional columns to create via merging as indicated in the provided information. Please note: no prior error messages were reported, so all parameters were selected based on exploring the R script and available metadata.\n",

      "Justification: The provided command-line arguments have been chosen based on several key considerations:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Kallisto Directory**: Set to the location of Kallisto output files as specified. This is essential for the analysis to find the appropriate quantification data.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **T2G File**: The path to the text-to-gene file is required for mapping transcript identifiers to gene identifiers, which is necessary for further analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Metadata**: The path to the metadata file must be provided to join with other datasets and get essential sample characteristics for analysis.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **Columns to Clean**: This parameter is specified as a JSON string mapping the original column names to cleaned names. The errors encountered previously arose because the original metadata columns had colons (':') which led to issues in processing through R's `dplyr` functions. The entries have been adjusted to match the cleaned column names as per the output from the `janitor` clean_names() function. Therefore, 'genotype:ch1' is referred to as 'genotype_ch1', and 'treatment:ch1' is referred to as 'treatment_ch1'. \n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Filter Group**: The grouping factor specified is 'genotype_clean'. This is essential for filtering based on the identified sample groups during DEGs analysis. \n",

      "6. **Output Directory**: This is the desired directory for saving output files generated by the script. The default inclusion makes organizational sense. \n",
      "\n",
      "7. **GEO-SRA Mapping**: The path to the GEO-SRA mapping file is included to link metadata with SRA IDs accurately.\n",
      "\n",
      "8. **Merge Columns**: As no new columns need to be created through merging based on previous findings, this parameter is set to NULL or its equivalent in command format.\n",
      "\n",
      "9. **Error Consideration**: Previous error messages indicated that the script was unable to locate the original column names due to incorrect naming in the cleaning function. Adjustments were made as per the new cleaned names.\n",

    "        You will be asked to perform part of an RNAseq analysis on a given dataset. The RNAseq analysis will begin from quantification files produced by Kallisto, and finish with the production of a DGEList object. The RNAseq analysis pipeline will be provided to you - note that this is an R script, with command line arguments. Your task will be to identify the most appropriate parameters for the command line arguments.\n",

    "        1. Carefully digest the R script that you will be using. \n",
    "        - Take note of the optional parameters\n",
    "        - Take note of the functions which are being used for each parameter to ascertain how each parameter is being used\n",
    "        - Take note of the description of each parameter to ascertain the necessary format required for the parameter\n",
    "        - Take careful note of packages such as \"janitor\" and other value clean-ups, which may change what the correct value should be. For example, if the original column name is \"genotype:ch1\", this will likely be changed to \"genotype_ch1\"\n",
    "        - Note that this R script has been carefully validated: there are no errors in the script\n",
    "        - The columns to clean should be used for any column that may be used for identification of DEGs\n",
    "        - The columns to merged should be used when identification of DEGs makes use of multiple groups simulataneously\n",
    "            - For example, if we are interested in \"Treatment X vs Y in Genotype A\", then the Treatment and Genotype columns should be merged\n",
    "        2. Carefully analyse the provided metadata as well as the study summary\n",
    "        - Do not assume any additional comparisons which are not explicitly provided\n",
    "        - Note that the study summary should be used to \n",
    "        - Keep in mind this recommendation: \"The filtering should be based on the grouping factors or treatment factors that will be involved in the differential expression test\"\n",
    "        3. After understanding the script and metadata, state the appropriate parameters that should be included.\n",
    "        - Note that mutate_columns is optional. If no columns should be joined, then specify NULL\n",
    "        4. If you have been provided error messages, take into consideration these error messages \n",
    "        ### OUTPUT \n",
    "        - Return the required command line arguments and justification for ALL included arguments\n",
    "        - If there was previous error messages, describe how you have incorporated this information in your response as part of the justificaiton \n",
