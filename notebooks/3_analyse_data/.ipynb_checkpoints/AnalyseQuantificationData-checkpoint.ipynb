      "\n",
      "### Step 1: Install and Load Required Libraries\n",
      "\n",
      "First, ensure you have the necessary R packages installed. You can install them using the `BiocManager` package for Bioconductor packages.\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Install BiocManager if it's not already installed\n",
      "if (!requireNamespace(\"BiocManager\", quietly = TRUE))\n",

      "# Load necessary libraries\n",
      "library(DESeq2)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 2: Read in the Kallisto `abundance.tsv` Files\n",
      "\n",
      "Assuming you have multiple Kallisto `abundance.tsv` files in a directory, you would typically read them and combine the counts into a single data frame. Here's how to do it:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Set working directory where the abundance.tsv files are located\n",
      "setwd(\"path/to/kallisto/files\")\n",
      "\n",
      "# List all abundance.tsv files\n",

      "  abundance_data <- read.table(file, header=TRUE, stringsAsFactors=FALSE)\n",
      "  # Extract gene names and counts (assuming 'est_counts' column contains raw counts)\n",
      "  abundance_list[[file]] <- abundance_data$est_counts\n",

      "\n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 3: Create a DESeq2 Dataset\n",
      "\n",
      "Next, you set up the condition for the comparison of interest (e.g., control vs treatment).\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Create a condition vector for your samples\n",
      "# Here, you define your conditions according to your study design\n",
      "condition <- factor(c(rep(\"control\", number_of_control_samples), \n",

      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 4: Perform Differential Expression Analysis\n",
      "\n",
      "Now, you can run the DESeq2 analysis:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "# Run the DESeq function\n",
      "dds <- DESeq(dds)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Get results\n",
      "res <- results(dds)\n",
      "\n",
      "# Convert to a data frame for easier manipulation\n",

      "# View results\n",
      "head(res_df)\n",

      "# Filter significant DEGs (adjust the threshold as needed)\n",
      "sig_res <- subset(res_df, padj < 0.05)\n",
      "```\n",
      "\n",
      "### Step 5: Save Results\n",
      "\n",
      "You can save the results to a file for further analysis or reporting:\n",
      "\n",
      "```R\n",
      "write.csv(sig_res, \"DEGs_results.csv\", row.names = TRUE)\n",

      "3. Set up conditions for your experimental design.\n",

      "   - **Justification:** Comparing gene expression between wild-type (WT) and GNAS knockout (GNAS KO) cellular models can provide insights into the role of GNAS in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL). This comparison may reveal specific pathways or gene targets regulated by GNAS, contributing to our understanding of tumor biology and potential therapeutic targets.\n",

Understanding the mechanisms of action and target pathways affected by RGFP966 can offer insights into therapeutic strategies for DLBCL.\n",

      "   - **Justification:** Investigating gene expression changes in GNAS knockout cells treated with RGFP966 versus DMSO allows for the assessment of compensatory mechanisms or alternative pathways engaged when GNAS is absent. This insight is critical to understand resistance mechanisms and refine treatment strategies for cancers with GNAS dysregulation.\n",

    "\n",
    "You are an expert and experienced bioinformatician and scientist, who focuses on clarifying analyses which will be meaningful to perform. \n",
    "\n",
    "You have been tasked with evaluating the potential scientific value of proposed comparisons. These comparisons are intended to be performed in a edgeR/limma-based RNA-seq pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "Take a deep breath, and carefully follow the below steps to achieve the best possible outcome.\n",
    "\n",
    "### STEPS \n",
    "\n",
    "1. You will be provided a Python dictionary of proposed scientific comparisons which have been proposed for a limma/edgeR RNAseq pipeline.\n",
    "- Do not propose any additional scientific comparisons beyond those specified in this Python dictionary\n",
    "- Throughout your evaluation, keep in mind that the analysis will be based on the construction of a contrast matrix, using the values specified in the column and values.\n",
    "2. You will also be provided metadata, which contains data that is mentioned in the Python dictionary. \n",
    "- Do NOT use this metadata to hallucinate additional comparisons\n",
    "- Use this metadata ONLY to gather additional context for the defined scientific comparisons.\n",
    "3. For each proposed analysis, assign a score between 1 - 5, based on the scientific value that can be extracted out of the comparison. Do this independently for each comparison. Use the below as a scoring guide:\n",
    "\n",
    "Score 5 – Outstanding Scientific Value\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe proposed comparison is highly relevant and addresses a significant scientific question or hypothesis.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison is likely to yield new and impactful insights that could lead to meaningful advancements in the field.\n",
    "\t•\tThe analysis is well-aligned with the biological context provided by the metadata and is expected to generate robust, interpretable results.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison is novel or provides a unique perspective that has not been previously explored.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score 4 – High Scientific Value\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe proposed comparison is scientifically sound and addresses an important question.\n",
    "\t•\tThe analysis has the potential to contribute valuable insights, though it may be incremental rather than groundbreaking.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison is well-supported by the metadata and is expected to produce meaningful results.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison adds depth to existing knowledge but may not be entirely novel.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score 3 – Moderate Scientific Value\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe proposed comparison is reasonable and could yield useful information.\n",
    "\t•\tThe analysis addresses a relevant question, though the scientific impact may be limited or somewhat unclear.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison is supported by the metadata but may not be as compelling or novel as higher-scoring comparisons.\n",
    "\t•\tThe results may be interesting but are likely to confirm existing knowledge rather than provide new insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score 2 – Low Scientific Value\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe proposed comparison is somewhat relevant but does not address a particularly important or novel question.\n",
    "\t•\tThe analysis may yield some useful data, but the scientific impact is expected to be minimal.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison is only partially supported by the metadata, and the results may be difficult to interpret or have limited applicability.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison may be redundant with existing analyses or provide only marginal additional insights.\n",
    "\n",
    "Score 1 – Minimal or No Scientific Value\n",
    "\n",
    "\t•\tThe proposed comparison is poorly conceived and unlikely to yield meaningful scientific insights.\n",
    "\t•\tThe analysis does not address a relevant or important question, or the rationale for the comparison is unclear.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison is not well-supported by the metadata, and the results are likely to be uninterpretable or irrelevant.\n",
    "\t•\tThe comparison may be redundant, trivial, or based on a flawed premise.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. For each comparison, also identify if it is redundant and/or overlapping with another comparison.\n",
    "- An example of this is identical \"column\" and \"values\" (e.g. column of \"A\" and values of \"val1, val2\" as compared to \"val2, val1\" or \"val1 - val2\")\n",
    "- **Important** Note that if comparison 1 is redundant with comparison 2, BOTH comparisons 1 and 2 should be marked as redundant.\n",
    "- Comparisons which are similar, but not overlapping, should not be classed as redundant\n",
    "- Only classify comparisons as redundant if you are highly confident that they are redundant\n",
    "- Keep in mind the analysis will be based on an edgeR/limma/DESeq2 pipeline - if two analyses are likely to require the identical experimental setup, these are redundant.\n",
    "- After evaluating all comparisons for redundancy, double check whether the intended repsonse for any other comparison needs to be altered accordingly.\n",
    "5. Based on your score evaluation and redundancy evaluation, make an evaluation as to whether each comparison should be retained. \n",
    "- When there are redundant comparisons, ONLY the comparison with the higher scientific value score should be retained\n",
    "- If redundant comparisons have the same scientific value score, then only retain one.\n",
    "6. Prior to reporting results, double check that your responses are reasonable, and you have followed the steps correctly.\n",
    "7. Report your results in accordance to the instructions in OUTPUT.\n",
    "\n",
    "### OUTPUT\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Include output for all proposed comparisons. Use the comparison name to describe each comparison.\n",
    "2. Specify the scientific evaluation score\n",
    "3. Include justification for the scientific evaluation score\n",
    "4. Specify if the comparison is redundant\n",
    "5. If redundant, justify why it is redundant. If not redundant, specify \"Not redundant\" for this field.\n",
    "- The justification for selecting which of the redundant comparisons, if any, should be specified here.\n",
    "6. Specify if the comparison should be retained or not\n",
