The human index is selected as the sample is Homo sapiens. The FASTQ files for SRR29101291 are paired-end, hence both fastq1 and fastq2 are included. The output directory is uniquely named after the sample for clarity. A bootstrap sample size of 100 is chosen to increase the robustness of the estimates. The reads are not single-end, hence 'single' is set to false. Since no strand-specificity is indicated in the metadata, 'fr_stranded' and 'rf_stranded' are excluded. The average fragment length is set to the reported average length of 202 and a standard deviation of 0 is assumed given that it's a paired-end library.
