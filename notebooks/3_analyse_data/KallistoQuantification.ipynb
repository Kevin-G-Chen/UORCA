    "You are an expert bioinformatician who specialises in RNA-seq data. You have great familiarity with the Kallisto tool, and use this in command line prompts to perform quantification.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "## STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Consider the list of FASTQ files. Use this to determine which files are matched with eachother - for example, the R1 and R2 files that correspond to eachother.\n",
    "2. Take into account that the path to the index file is ~/work/data/kallisto_indices/human/index.idx\n",
    "3. Take into consideration this documentation for kallisto quant:\n",

    "kallisto 0.50.0\n",
    "Computes equivalence classes for reads and quantifies abundances\n",

    "-o, --output-dir=STRING       Directory to write output to\n",
    "\n",
    "Optional arguments:\n",
    "-b, --bootstrap-samples=INT   Number of bootstrap samples (default: 0)\n",
    "    --seed=INT                Seed for the bootstrap sampling (default: 42)\n",
    "    --plaintext               Output plaintext instead of HDF5\n",
    "    --single                  Quantify single-end reads\n",
    "    --single-overhang         Include reads where unobserved rest of fragment is\n",

    "\n",
    "kallisto quant:\n",
    "\n",
    "--bias learns parameters for a model of sequences specific bias and corrects the abundances accordlingly.\n",
    "\n",
    "--fusion does normal quantification, but additionally looks for reads that do not pseudoalign because they are potentially from fusion genes. All output is written to the file fusion.txt in the output folder.\n",
    "\n",
    "--pseudobam outputs all pseudoalignments to a file pseudoalignments.bam in the output directory. This BAM file contains the pseudoalignments in BAM format, ordered by reads so that each pseudoalignment of a read is adjacent in the BAM file.\n",
    "\n",
    "--genomebam constructs the pseudoalignments to the transcriptome, but projects the transcript alignments to genome coordinates, resulting in split-read alignments. When the --genomebam option is supplied at GTF file must be given with the --gtf option. The GTF file, which can be plain text or gzipped, translates transcripts into genomic coordinates. We recommend downloading a the cdna FASTA files and GTF files from the same data source. The --chromosomes option can provide a length of the genomic chromosomes, this option is not neccessary, but gives a more consistent BAM header, some programs may require this for downstream analysis. kallisto does not require the genome sequence to do pseudoalignment, but downstream tools such as genome browsers will probably need it.\n",

    "4. Carefully consider what you know about using Kallisto for quantification, and provide code to quantify ALL provided FASTQ files in a way that is biologically meaningful. Take into account:\n",
    "- relevant output directories\n",
    "- that all FASTQ files should be quantified in a biologically accurate manner\n",
    "5. Provide a SINGLE command that can be used to perform quantification. This command should be something that can be copy-pasted into the command line\n",
    "6. For each parameter that is specified in the kallisto command, include a justification for why the parameter was included\n",
    "7. For any other part of the command (e.g. wrapping in a for loop), include a justification for why this is necesssary\n",

    "Your output should be structured with the following components. Do not include any information that does not belong in a component. For example, any output for \"command\" should ONLY include code, and no additional comments or commentary:\n",

    "\n",
    "## STEPS\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Carefully digest the Kallisto command that was given to you, and consider whether the command is likely to represent a reasonable method of quantifying samples. Take into account:\n",
    "- If ALL FASTQ files were correctly analysed. Note that the FASTQ files are here:\n",
    "\n",
    "{formatted_fastq_files}\n",

    "- whether the code follows the documentation of the appropriate Kallisto version, provided here:\n",

    "\n",
    "- whether the parameters included in the Kallisto command are logical and biologically sound given the input and documentation\n",
    "- whether there are any potential issues regarding validity and reliability\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Carefully digest the command's output, for example taking note of:\n",
    "- whether or not there were errors\n",
    "- whether or not there were warnings\n",
    "- check for compatibility issues with asyncio.create_subprocess_shell execution.\n",
    "- verify that all shell syntax used is POSIX-compliant and avoids bash-specific features.\n",
    "- proper escaping of special characters for both shell and Python string contexts.\n",
    "- potential issues with command length or complexity that might cause problems in subprocess execution.\n",
    "- if any part of the command might be causing the process to hang or timeout\n",
    "\n",
    "3. After considering the above, provide feedback about:\n",
    "- if the command should be rewritten. Note that:\n",
    "    - if there were ANY errors, the command should be rewritten\n",
    "    - if there were warnings, consider if the warning contributes to a biologically meaningful difference: if the warning does not affect the intended function of the comand, it can be ignored. However, if the warning indicates the command's outcome could be biologically compromised, the command should be rewritten to address the issue.\n",
    "- IF the command is to be rewritten, then take into account the stderr and stdout output, and use this to inform about\n",
    "    - the likely source of error(s) and/or warning(s)\n",
    "    - an analysis of ALL parameters being used, and whether they should be changed\n",
    "    - an analysis of whether the exclusion of any parameters might be appropriate\n",
    "    - a suggested code rewrite.\n",
