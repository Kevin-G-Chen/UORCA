Using DESeq2, a comparison of gene expression between the customer-defined groups of samples was performed.",Supplementary files format and content: RNA-seq: tab-delimited text file includes TPM values for each sample,GPL24676,"Lopa,,Mishra",lopamishra2@gmail.com,The Feinstein Institutes for Medical Research & Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory,350 Community Drive,Manhasset,NY,11030,USA,0,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,cDNA,transcriptomic,RNA-Seq,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN42940197,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX25524115,NONE,"coculture human liver cells: hepatocyte, Kupffer cell, stellate cell",96h,liver,50nM siSptbn1
