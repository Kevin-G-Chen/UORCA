I will be providing a metadata sheet with mistakes to see how this will work.). Note that the prompt I end up needing here might have to be revised based on how I go with the dataset download.\n",
    "- Create (what I assume is) the DGEList object in Python, i.e. via PyDESeq2. If I can't get this to work, I will create an R script and call this script in Python. This is true for future steps too. Note that part of this entails being able to match samples to the correct files\n",

    "- Perform an ORA/GSEA. If I can get the above to work, this should be straightforward."
