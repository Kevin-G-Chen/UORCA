This was defined based on the mean and standard deviation (s.d.) of ùëôùëúùëî‚àí10 normalized target group genes. The calculation is: LoD = mean + (2 √ó s.d.). A gene was filtered/counted as detected only if it exceeded the LoD in at least 10% of all ROIs. ROIs that did not have the filtering criteria were excluded from further analyses",Assembly: GeoMx¬Æ Human Whole Transcriptome Atlas,Supplementary files format and content: DCC files are converted from fastq files from the GeoMX NGS Pipeline,Supplementary files format and content: Normalized_Counts.xlsx contains read counts from all ROI over the 10% LoD threshold and after Q3 normalization.,Library strategy: Spatial Transcriptomics,GPL24676,"Clinton,,Enos",Enoscw@evms.edu,Dermatology,Eastern Virginia Medical School,"721 Fairfax Avenue, Suite 200",Norfolk,Virginia,23507,USA,0,Illumina NovaSeq 6000,other,transcriptomic,OTHER,BioSample: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/biosample/SAMN42840536,SRA: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra?term=SRX25487628,ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/samples/GSM8424nnn/GSM8424560/suppl/GSM8424560_DSP-1006280000601-E01.dcc.gz,HS,4,Epi Deep Tunnel,922,196447.7,Skin
