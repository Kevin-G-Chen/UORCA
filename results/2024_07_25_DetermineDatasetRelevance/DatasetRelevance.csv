0,200270741,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [WM35],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",GSE270741,2024/07/24,Not Relevant,3/3,"The study focuses on melanoma and its resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapies for lung cancer.; This dataset focuses on melanoma and its resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which does not directly pertain to lung cancer immunotherapies.; This dataset focuses on melanoma, which is a different type of cancer from lung cancer.

2,200268242,Anti-tumor Efficacy of HRS-4642 and Its Potential Combination with Proteasome Inhibition in KRAS G12D-mutant Cancer [CRISPR],"KRAS G12D is the most frequently mutated oncogenic KRAS subtype in solid tumors and remains undruggable in clinical settings. Here, we developed a high affinity, selective, long-acting, and non-covalent KRAS G12D inhibitor, HRS-4642, with an affinity constant of 0.083 nM. HRS-4642 demonstrats robust efficacy against KRAS G12D-mutant cancers both in vitro and in vivo. Importantly, in a phase 1 clinical trial, HRS-4642 exhibits promising anti-tumor activity in the escalating dosing cohorts. Furthermore, the sensitization and resistance spectrum for HRS-4642 was deciphered through genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screening, which unveiled the proteasome as a synergistic target. We further observed that the proteasome inhibitor, carfilzomib, prominently improved the anti-tumor efficacy of HRS-4642. Additionally, HRS-4642, especially when combined with carfilzomib, significantly reshapes the tumor microenvironment towards an immune permissive one. In summary, this study provides potential therapies for patients with KRAS G12D-mutant cancers, for whom effective treatments are currently lacking.",GSE268242,2024/07/12,Not Relevant,3/3,"The research is centered around KRAS G12D-mutant cancers, which does not specifically address lung cancer immunotherapies.; This dataset is centered around KRAS G12D-mutant cancers, which may not be directly tied to the broader scope of lung cancer immunotherapy.; This dataset investigates KRAS G12D-mutant cancers, which are not specifically lung cancer-focused, and it does not explore immunotherapies.

3,200261624,Gene expression profile of all CD4 T cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes of SPF and Nippostrongylus Brasiliensis infected mice,"The discovery of naïve T cell transcriptional heterogeneity in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice represents a paradigm shift. While the ablation of Vista can alter the proportion of naïve CD4+ T cells with unique transcriptional signatures and the ‘readiness’ of the mice to break tolerance, the effect of non-heritable environmental exposures to commensals or infections remains entirely unknown. This is especially significant since individual variance in immune response, rather than being genetically inherited, is mostly attributed to environmental factors. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional heterogeneity characterizes even the germ-free (GF) mouse naïve CD4+ T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cell transcriptional subsets and their proportions were identical between GF, SPF and conventionalized GF mice, thus commensal-independent. Notwithstanding, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N.b.) infection altered the proportions of these transcriptional subsets, and the appearance of cells with a unique transcriptional signature. These naïve T cell-intrinsic changes accounted for the decreased immunization response of mice to an unrelated antigen. The compositional and functional changes in the naïve CD4+ T cell pool were dependent-variables of helminth infection, regressing with N.b. clearance. Therefore, naïve T cells are not uniformly uncommitted substrates for antigen-dependent activation but actively integrate environmental cues to permute the magnitude of the immune response.",GSE261624,2024/07/25,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset primarily deals with CD4 T cells in mice and environmental factors affecting immune response, lacking direct relevance to lung cancer immunotherapies.; The focus is on transcriptional heterogeneity in T cells influenced by infection, lacking a direct link to lung cancer or immunotherapy.; This dataset examines T cell responses in a mouse model unrelated to lung cancer.

4,200270084,"Genome-wide Methylation Patterns in Primary Uveal Melanoma: MethylSig-UM, an Epigenomic Prognostic Signature to Improve Patient Stratification","Despite studies highlighting the prognostic utility of DNA methylation in primary uveal melanoma (pUM), it has not been translated into a clinically-useful tool. We sought to define a methylation signature to identify newly diagnosed individuals at high risk for developing metastasis. Methylation profiling was performed on 41 pUM with at least three years of follow-up using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (n=24) and the EPIC BeadChip (n= 17). Findings were validated in the TCGA cohort with known metastatic outcome (n=69). Differentially methylated probes were identified in patients who developed metastasis. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three epigenomic subtypes associated with metastasis. To identify a prognostic signature, recursive feature elimination and random forest models were utilized within repeated cross-validation iterations. The 250 most commonly selected probes compose the final signature, named MethylSig-UM. MethylSig-UM can distinguish individuals with pUM at diagnosis who developed future metastasis with an area under the curve of ~81% in the independent validation cohort, and remains significant in Cox proportional hazard models when combined with clinical features and established genomic biomarkers. Altered expression of immune modulating genes were detected in MethylSig-UM positive tumors, providing clues for pUM resistance to immunotherapy. The MethylSig-UM model is available to enable additional validation.",GSE270084,2024/07/24,Not Relevant,3/3,"The focus of this study is on uveal melanoma and its methylation patterns, which are not applicable to lung cancer immunotherapy.; The research emphasizes DNA methylation in uveal melanoma, which is not relevant to lung cancer or its immunotherapies.; This dataset is about primary uveal melanoma and its methylation patterns.

5,200268049,The effect of exposure to neighborhood violence on GR signaling in lung tumors [Spatial Transcriptomics],"Despite lower rates and intensity of smoking, Black men experience a higher incidence of lung cancer compared to White men. The racial disparity in lung cancer is particularly pronounced in Chicago, a highly segregated urban city. Neighborhood conditions, particularly social stress, may play a role in lung tumorigenesis. Preliminary studies indicate that Black men residing in neighborhoods with higher rates of violent crime have significantly higher levels of hair cortisol, an indicator of stress response. To examine the relationship between social stress exposure and gene expression in lung tumors, we investigated glucocorticoid receptor (GR) binding in lung tumor samples in relation to GR target gene expression levels and zip code level residential neighborhood violence. Spatial transcriptomics and a version of ChIP-sequencing known as CUT & RUN were used. GR recruitment to chromatin was correlated with neighborhood violent crime rate and overall GR binding increased with increasing neighborhood violent crime rates. Among patients residing in high-violence neighborhoods, tumor samples, compared to normal neighboring lung tissue, had fewer GR binding sites. The opposite was seen in patients residing in low-violence neighborhoods, with tumor samples having more GR binding sites when compared to normal lung tissue. Tumor samples from patients living in high-violence neighborhoods exhibited increased GR recruitment to genes associated with greater tumor aggressiveness. Our findings suggest that exposure to neighborhood violence may influence tumor biology via reprogramming GR recruitment.

Here, we show in two independent cohorts of patients with non-small cell lung cancer and advanced melanoma that high level of F. prausnitzii at baseline is positively associated with a better clinical response to ICI. In a mouse preclinical model, we show that the F. prausnitzii strain EXL01, already in clinical development for Inflammatory Bowel Disease, restores the anti-tumor response to ICI in the context of antibiotic-induced microbiota perturbation at clinical and tumor transcriptomics level. In vitro, EXL01 strain enhances T cell activation in the presence of ICI.

11,200241235,A novel adjuvant formulation induces robust Th1/Th17 memory and mucosal recall responses in Non-Human Primates,"After clean drinking water, vaccination is the most impactful global health intervention. However, development of new vaccines against difficult-to-target diseases is hampered by the lack of diverse adjuvants for human use. Of particular interest, none of the currently available adjuvants induce Th17 cells. Here, we develop and test an improved liposomal adjuvant, termed CAF®10b, that incorporates a TLR-9 agonist. In a head-to-head study in non-human primates (NHPs), immunization with antigen adjuvanted with CAF®10b induced significantly increased antibody and cellular immune responses compared to previous CAF® adjuvants, already in clinical trials. This was not seen in the mouse model, demonstrating that adjuvant effects can be highly species specific. Importantly, intramuscular immunization of NHPs with CAF®10b induced robust Th17 responses that were observed in circulation half a year after vaccination. Furthermore, subsequent instillation of unadjuvanted antigen into the skin and lungs of these memory animals led to significant recall responses including transient local lung inflammation observed by Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT), elevated antibody titers, and expanded systemic and local Th1 and Th17 responses, including >20% antigen-specific T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage.

In addition, the combination of anti-PDL1 therapy with LSD1i-based ACT resulted in a complete tumor eradication and long-lasting tumor-free survival. This study demonstrated that LSD1i together with anti-PDL1 therapy complement each other’s deficiencies and produce a better tumor response in a melanoma model, in which both immune and epigenetic therapy alone have shown limited efficacy.

In this pilot study, we exposed two pigtail macaques (PTMs) chronically infected with SIVmac239, exhibiting from very low to no CD4 T cells across all compartments, to SARS-CoV-2. We monitored the disease progression, viral replication and evolution, and compared these outcomes with SIV-naïve PTMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. No overt signs of COVID-19 disease were observed in either animal, and the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and evolution in the SIVmac239 PTMs were indistinguishable from those in the SIV-naïve PTMs in all sampled mucosal sites. However, the single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells revealed an infiltration of functionally inert monocytes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Critically, neither of the SIV-infected PTMs mounted detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses nor anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding or neutralizing antibodies.

17,200269899,Identification of resistance mechanisms to small-molecule inhibition of YAP/TEAD-regulated transcription [RNA-seq],"The Hippo tumour suppressor pathway controls transcription by regulating nuclear abundance of YAP and TAZ, which activate transcription with the TEAD1-TEAD4 DNA-binding proteins. Recently, several small-molecule inhibitors of YAP and TEADs have been reported, with some now entering clinical trials for different cancers. Here, we investigated the cellular response to TEAD palmitoylation inhibitors, using genomic and genetic strategies. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 screens revealed that mutations in genes from the Hippo, MAPK and JAK-STAT signaling pathways all modulate the cellular response to TEAD inhibition. Inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation strongly reduced YAP/TEAD target expression, whilst only mildly impacting YAP/TEAD genome binding. Additionally, expression of MAPK pathway genes was induced upon inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation, which coincided with YAP/TEAD redistribution to AP-1 transcription factor binding sites. Consistent with this, combined inhibition of TEAD and the MAPK protein MEK, synergistically blocked proliferation of several mesothelioma and lung cancer cell lines and more potently reduced the growth of patient-derived lung cancers in vivo. Collectively, we reveal mechanisms by which cells can overcome small-molecule inhibition of TEAD palmitoylation and potential strategies to enhance the anti-tumor activity of emerging Hippo pathway targeted therapies.",GSE269899,2024/07/08,Not Relevant,3/3,"This dataset focuses on resistance mechanisms in small-molecule inhibition, not specifically linked to lung cancer immunotherapy.; This dataset focuses on YAP/TEAD transcription regulation, lacking direct implications for lung cancer immunotherapy.; Focused on YAP/TEAD transcription regulation in cancer, this dataset does not specifically address lung cancer or its immunotherapy."

22,200269394,Long-lived central memory gamma delta T cells confer protection against murine cytomegalovirus reinfection,"The involvement of γδ TCR-bearing lymphocytes in immunological memory has gained increasing interest due to their functional duality between adaptive and innate immunity. γδ T effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) subsets have been identified, but their respective roles in memory responses are poorly understood. In the present study, we used subsequent mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections of αβ T cell deficient mice in order to analyze the memory potential of γδ T cells. As for CMV-specific αβ T cells, MCMV induced the accumulation of cytolytic, KLRG1+CX3CR1+ γδ TEM that principally localized in infected organ vasculature. Typifying T cell memory, γδ T cell expansion in organs and blood was higher and more efficient after secondary viral challenge than after primary infection. Viral control upon MCMV reinfection was prevented when masking γδ T-cell receptor, and was associated with a preferential amplification of private and unfocused TCR δ chain repertoire composed of a combination of clonotypes expanded post-primary infection and, more unexpectedly, of novel expanded clonotypes. Finally, long-term-primed γδ TCM cells, but not γδ TEM cells, protected T cell-deficient hosts against MCMV-induced death upon adoptive transfer, probably through their ability to survive and to generate TEM in the recipient host. This better survival potential of TCM cells was confirmed by a detailed scRNASeq analysis of these two γδ T cell subsets which also revealed their similarity to classically adaptive αβ CD8 T cells. Overall, our study uncovered memory properties of long-lived TCM γδ T cells that confer protection in a chronic infection, highlighting the interest of this T cell subset in vaccination approaches.",GSE269394,2024/07/25,Not Relevant,3/3,"The dataset examines γδ T cells' role in response to murine cytomegalovirus, focusing on mouse models, and does not directly relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy for lung cancer.

24,200245807,HMGA1 causes a global shift in chromatin architecture linked to transcriptional changes [scRNA-Seq],"High Mobility Group A1 (HMGA1) is an architectural chromatin-binding protein that regulates gene expression in various biological contexts, including differentiation and cancer. While previous studies show that HMGA1 acts by binding specific gene promoters or by contributing to the enhanceosome, its global effect on transcription remains unclear. HMGA1 is also critical for the formation of senescence-associated heterochromatic foci (SAHF) in oncogene-induced senescence (OIS), a stable form of cell cycle arrest with a pro-inflammatory phenotype. This link between the two roles of HMGA1, gene regulation and chromatin organisation, has not been fully explained. Here, we used graph theory and data integration from high-throughput assays to investigate how HMGA1 binding impacts the chromatin interactions network. Our results demonstrate that HMGA1 profoundly remodels the global chromatin network during OIS and contributes to stronger compartmentalization. This remodelling goes beyond SAHF, leading to substantial gene repositioning and differential gene expression, highlighting a novel role for HMGA1 in altering chromatin environments. The HMGA1 effects of gene expression go beyond senescence and appear to be relevant in other contexts, such as lung cancer.",GSE245807,2024/07/08,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset discusses the role of HMGA1 in lung cancer, its effects on transcription, and its relevance to chromatin architecture.

25,200239389,Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 inhibits proliferation and metabolism in non–small cell lung cancer cells in HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manner,"Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-α. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression.",GSE239389,2024/07/17,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset investigates PHD2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), emphasizing its potential role as a tumor suppressor and its impact on metabolic processes.

26,200246354,GCN2 is a determinant of the response to WEE1 kinase inhibition in small-cell lung cancer,"Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) are in dire need of more effective therapeutic options. Frequent disruption of the G1 checkpoint in SCLC cells creates a greater dependency of these cells on the G2/M checkpoint to maintain genomic integrity. Indeed, in pre-clinical models, inhibiting the G2/M kinase WEE1 shows promise in inhibiting SCLC growth. However, toxicity and acquired resistance limit the clinical effectiveness of this strategy. Here we conducted CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes influencing the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 kinase inhibition. These screens uncovered a role for the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway in modulating the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 inhibition. Rapid activation of GCN2 upon WEE1 inhibition triggers a stress response. Pharmacological activation of the GCN2 pathway synergizes with WEE1 inhibition. Thus, activation of the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway represents a novel approach for augmenting the efficacy of WEE1 inhibitors in SCLC.",GSE246354,2024/07/16,Relevant,3/3,"The dataset explores responses to WEE1 kinase inhibition in small-cell lung cancer, identifying potential therapeutic pathways.

27,200272045,Identification of mutant KRAS-related genes associated with malignant phenotypes in NSCLC,"Oncogenic KRAS is found in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we conducted microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that although the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is significantly downregulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho–epidermal growth factor receptor, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment, but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs. Detailed information on the microarray results are available in a previous study (Sunaga N, et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2011;10:336-46).",GSE272045,2024/07/16,Relevant,3/3,"This dataset focuses on the role of mutant KRAS in NSCLC, a major target for lung cancer therapies.
