0,200270741,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [WM35],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",GSE270741,2024/07/24,1.0,"[1, 1, 1]","Attempt 1: Score 1 - The dataset focuses on melanoma and immune checkpoint inhibitors in melanoma patients.

5,200241235,A novel adjuvant formulation induces robust Th1/Th17 memory and mucosal recall responses in Non-Human Primates,"After clean drinking water, vaccination is the most impactful global health intervention. However, development of new vaccines against difficult-to-target diseases is hampered by the lack of diverse adjuvants for human use. Of particular interest, none of the currently available adjuvants induce Th17 cells. Here, we develop and test an improved liposomal adjuvant, termed CAF®10b, that incorporates a TLR-9 agonist. In a head-to-head study in non-human primates (NHPs), immunization with antigen adjuvanted with CAF®10b induced significantly increased antibody and cellular immune responses compared to previous CAF® adjuvants, already in clinical trials. This was not seen in the mouse model, demonstrating that adjuvant effects can be highly species specific. Importantly, intramuscular immunization of NHPs with CAF®10b induced robust Th17 responses that were observed in circulation half a year after vaccination. Furthermore, subsequent instillation of unadjuvanted antigen into the skin and lungs of these memory animals led to significant recall responses including transient local lung inflammation observed by Positron Emission Tomography-Computed Tomography (PET-CT), elevated antibody titers, and expanded systemic and local Th1 and Th17 responses, including >20% antigen-specific T cells in the bronchoalveolar lavage. Overall, CAF®10b demonstrated an adjuvant able to drive true memory antibody, Th1 and Th17 vaccine-responses across rodent and primate species, supporting its translational potential.",GSE241235,2024/07/24,1.0,"[1, 0, 2]","Attempt 1: Score 1 - While this study involves vaccination and immune responses, it is conducted in non-human primates and does not address lung cancer or relevant therapeutics.; Attempt 2: Score 0 - This dataset pertains to vaccine development in non-human primates, with no connections to lung cancer or immunotherapies relevant to the research query.; Attempt 3: Score 2 - Although the study investigates vaccine adjuvants, it focuses on non-human primates and does not specifically address lung cancer immunotherapies.

10,200272770,LSD1 inhibition improves efficacy of adoptive T cell therapy by enhancing CD8+ T cell responsiveness,"The lysine-specific histonedemethylase1A(LSD1) has been described to play a role in antitumor immunity; however, the role of LSD1 in shaping CD8+ T cell (CTL) differentiation and function is not understood. Here, we showed that pharmacological inhibition of LSD1 (LSD1i) in CTL elicited phenotypic and functional alterations of the CTL that led to robust antitumor immunity in the context of adoptive T cell therapy (ACT). In addition, the combination of anti-PDL1 therapy with LSD1i-based ACT resulted in a complete tumor eradication and long-lasting tumor-free survival. This study demonstrated that LSD1i together with anti-PDL1 therapy complement each other’s deficiencies and produce a better tumor response in a melanoma model, in which both immune and epigenetic therapy alone have shown limited efficacy. Collectively, these results set the translational potential of modulating LSD1 to improve antitumoral responses generated by ACT and anti-PDL1 therapy, which provide a strong rationale for a combination trial of LSD1i and immunotherapy.",GSE272770,2024/07/23,6.7,"[6, 7, 7]","Attempt 1: Score 6 - The dataset explores LSD1 inhibition and its impacts on CD8+ T cells, which is relevant to T cell-based immunotherapy approaches, although it does not specifically target lung cancer.; Attempt 2: Score 7 - This study investigates LSD1 inhibition within CD8+ T cells, which can be relevant to adoptive T cell therapy for lung cancer.

11,200272713,"The Impact of SIV-Induced Immunodeficiency on SARS-CoV-2 Disease, Viral Dynamics, and Antiviral Immune Response in a Nonhuman Primate Model of Coinfection","Abstract: The effects of immunodeficiency associated with chronic HIV infection on COVID-19 disease and viral persistence have not been directly addressed in a controlled setting. In this pilot study, we exposed two pigtail macaques (PTMs) chronically infected with SIVmac239, exhibiting from very low to no CD4 T cells across all compartments, to SARS-CoV-2. We monitored the disease progression, viral replication and evolution, and compared these outcomes with SIV-naïve PTMs infected with SARS-CoV-2. No overt signs of COVID-19 disease were observed in either animal, and the SARS-CoV-2 viral kinetics and evolution in the SIVmac239 PTMs were indistinguishable from those in the SIV-naïve PTMs in all sampled mucosal sites. However, the single-cell RNA sequencing of bronchoalveolar lavage cells revealed an infiltration of functionally inert monocytes after SARS-CoV-2 infection. Critically, neither of the SIV-infected PTMs mounted detectable anti-SARS-CoV-2 T-cell responses nor anti-SARS-CoV-2 binding or neutralizing antibodies. Thus, HIV-induced immunodeficiency alone may not be sufficient to drive the emergence of novel viral variants but may remove the ability of infected individuals to mount adaptive immune responses against SARS-CoV-2.",GSE272713,2024/07/23,1.0,"[1, 0, 2]","Attempt 1: Score 1 - Although this dataset explores SIV immunodeficiency's effects on SARS-CoV-2, it does not target lung cancer immunotherapies and focuses on viral infections.; Attempt 2: Score 0 - This dataset discusses SIV and its impact on COVID-19, which is not related to lung cancer or immunotherapies for lung cancer.; Attempt 3: Score 2 - This pilot study discusses immunodeficiency and SARs-CoV-2 dynamics in a nonhuman primate model.

12,200264734,Metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors to protect plants against viral induced cellular damage,"RNA viruses co-opt host intracellular structures to create specialized replication sites and advance infection. The response of the host to this membrane disruption is poorly understood. In this study, we explore Arabidopsis thaliana's reaction to three distinct viruses that commandeer varying cellular compartments. Our findings reveal autophagy is significantly induced within systemically infected tissues, with autophagy disruption rendering plants highly sensitive to infection. Contrary to being an antiviral defense, quantitative analyses of viral RNA and proteomes establish autophagy as a critical component of the host's tolerance mechanism. Further analysis of mitochondrial hijacking by the Turnip Crinkle Virus has shown that despite perturbing mitochondrial integrity, the virus does not trigger a typical mitophagy response. Instead, viral infection activates a distinct selective autophagy mechanism, where oligomeric metabolic enzymes moonlight as selective autophagy receptors and degrade key executors of defense and cell death. Altogether, our study reveals an autophagy-regulated metabolic rheostats that gauges cellular integrity during viral infection.",GSE264734,2024/07/23,0.7,"[0, 0, 2]","Attempt 1: Score 0 - This dataset involves plant responses to viral infections, which is entirely irrelevant to human lung cancer or immunotherapies.; Attempt 2: Score 0 - This dataset is focused on plant biology, specifically viral infection in plants, with no relevance to lung cancer or immunotherapy.; Attempt 3: Score 2 - The study focuses on plant viral infections and responses, which is not relevant to lung cancer or immunotherapies as outlined in the query.

Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice.

17,200247647,Cell state and transcription factor modulation during extended CD8+ T-cell expansion ex vivo,"Adoptive cell therapy is fast becoming a cornerstone of modern tumour immunotherapy. It relies on the relatively long-term (>2 week) ex vivo expansion of T cells either in the form of tumour-infiltrating cells, or bulk cells modified with the expression of heterologous signaling proteins, e.g., chimeric antigen receptors.

Using bulk RNA-seq analysis of T cells expanded and rested over a 17-day period, we provide a resource of how gene expression changes as cells transition through distinct cellular states over the course of activation and ex-vivo expansion.

18,200251937,In situ targeted gene expression analysis of Marjolin ulcers,"Marjolin's ulcer is a a rare and aggressive cutaneous malignancy that can arise on previously injured skin, established scars, and chronic non-healing wounds. It is most often found in burn scars, but it can also occur in other types of wounds, including venous stasis ulcers, pressure sores, and vaccination sites. The most common histological type of Marjolin’s ulcers is squamous cell carcinoma, however basal cell carcinomas, malignant melanomas, and sarcomas have also been reported. All parts of the body could potentially be affected yet the lower extremities are the anatomic sites most commonly involved. While SCCs commonly have a metastasis rate of 0.5 to 3.0 percent, those arising from burn scars metastasize at a rate in excess of 30 percent. The 5-year survival after a diagnosis of Marjolin’s ulcer was found to be 50 percent. The transformation to a malignancy can occur either chronically, over a period of more than 35 years, or occasionally within a year of the original injury. The exact mechanism of this transformation is not fully understood, but it is thought to be related to chronic keratinocyte dysfunction during the healing process of severe burn wounds. Surgical excision is the main treatment for Marjolin's ulcer and provides the best chance of survival. In a previous study, we investigated the bulk transcriptional changes that lead to Marjolin's ulcer by comparing global gene expression changes between squamous cells present in a squamous cell carcinoma versus those present within Marjolin's ulcer (MU) (Sinha et. al. JBCR 2017). This imparted novel insights into mechanisms underlying divergent clinical features of these cutaneous cancers. The goal of our current study is to characterize a new case of Marjolin's ulcer in a patient under our care by analyzing the cell types, their frequencies, and their individual transcriptional responses within a burn scar versus within Marjolin's ulcer. To achieve this, we conducted single-cell RNA sequencing on two excised tissues: 1. a sample from the center of the tumor (tumor core), and 2. another sample from the margin of tumor-free scar tissue.",GSE251937,2024/07/21,0.7,"[0, 0, 2]","Attempt 1: Score 0 - This study involves Marjolin's ulcers and does not align with lung cancer or relevant immunotherapies.; Attempt 2: Score 0 - The focus on Marjolin's ulcer and cutaneous malignancies presents no relevance to lung cancer or its immunotherapy.; Attempt 3: Score 2 - This dataset centers on Marjolin's ulcer, a skin cancer with less direct relevance to lung cancer immunotherapy.

19,200244808,Probiotic neoantigen delivery vectors for precision cancer immunotherapy,"Microbial systems have been synthetically engineered to deploy therapeutic payloads in vivo. With emerging evidence that bacteria naturally home to tumors and modulate anti-tumor immunity one promising application is the development of bacterial vectors as precision cancer vaccines. In this study, we engineered probiotic E. coli Nissle 1917 (EcN) as an anti-tumor vaccination platform optimized for enhanced production and cytosolic delivery of neoepitope-containing peptide arrays, with increased susceptibility to blood clearance and phagocytosis. These features enhance both safety and immunogenicity, achieving a system which drives potent and specific T cell–mediated anti‑cancer immunity that effectively controls or eliminates tumor growth and extends survival in advanced murine primary and metastatic solid tumors. We demonstrate that the elicited anti-tumor immune response involves extensive priming and activation of neoantigen-specific CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, broader activation of both T and NK cells, and a reduction of tumor-infiltrating immunosuppressive myeloid and regulatory T and B cell populations. Taken together, this work leverages the advantages of living medicines to deliver arrays of tumor‑specific neoantigen–derived epitopes within the optimal context to induce specific, effective, and durable systemic anti-tumor immunity.",GSE244808,2024/07/21,6.3,"[6, 6, 7]","Attempt 1: Score 6 - The dataset investigates engineered bacterial vectors and their immunogenic response, leveraging insights into tumor immunotherapy.

21,200270050,Antigen-Dependent Differentiation and Expansion of Tumor-Infiltrating CD8+ T Cell Clonotypes Occurs in the Spleen in Response to Immune Checkpoint Blockade,"Immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) enhances tumor-reactive T cell responses against cancer, leading to long-term tumor control and survival in a fraction of patients. Given the increasingly recognized complexity of CD8+ T cell differentiation that occurs in response to chronic antigen stimulation, it remains unclear precisely which T cell differentiation states are critical for the response to ICB, as well as the anatomic sites at which ICB-mediated reinvigoration of these T cells occurs. We used paired single-cell RNA and T cell receptor (TCR) sequencing to profile endogenous, tumor-reactive CD8+ T cells isolated from tumors, tumor-draining lymph nodes, and spleens of mice treated with ICB. We identified an intermediate-exhausted population of T cells in the spleen which underwent the greatest expansion in response to ICB and gave rise to the majority of tumor-infiltrating clonotypes. Increasing concentrations of systemic antigen perturbed the differentiation of this phenotype towards an exhausted_KLR state, while a lack of cross-presentation of tumor-derived antigen blunted differentiation in the spleen. We identified an analogous population of exhausted_KLR CD8+ T cells in matched human tumor and blood samples that exhibited diminished tumor-trafficking ability. Collectively, our data demonstrate the critical role of antigen density within the spleen in coordinating the differentiation and expansion of tumor-infiltrating T cell clonotypes in response to ICB.",GSE270050,2024/07/19,8.7,"[9, 9, 8]","Attempt 1: Score 9 - This dataset directly investigates tumor-infiltrating CD8+ T cells in the context of immune checkpoint blockade, which is highly relevant to immunotherapy for cancers, including lung cancer.

23,200242839,PD-1 is induced on tumor-associated macrophages in obesity to directly restrain anti-tumor immunity,"Obesity is a leading risk factor for progression and metastasis of many cancers1,2, yet can also promote improved survival for some cancers3-5 and enhance responses to some immune checkpoint blockade therapies6-8. The role of the immune system in the obesity-cancer connection and how obesity influences immunotherapy, however, remain unclear. While PD-1 expression by macrophages has been described9-12, we found that obesity selectively induced PD-1 on macrophages and that PD-1 directly impaired macrophage function. Single cell RNA sequencing of murine colorectal carcinoma tumors showed obesity remodeled myeloid and T cell populations, with fewer clonally expanded effector T cells and increased abundance of PD-1+ tumor-associated macrophages (TAM). Cytokines and molecules associated with obesity, including IL-6, leptin, and insulin, and the unsaturated fatty acid palmitate, induced PD-1 expression on macrophages in a glycolysis-dependent manner and that MTORC1 pathway signaling is essential for PD1 expression. PD-1+ TAMs had increased mitochondrial respiration, fatty acid metabolism and cell cylewhile PD-1- TAMs had increased inflammatory signature , phagocytosis and antigen presentation to T cells. These patterns were directly regulated by PD-1, as recombinant PD-L1 reduced macrophage glycolysis, phagocytic capacity and antigen presentation, and this was reversed with blocking PD-1 antibody. Further, inhibition of glycolysis with 2-deoxyglucose prevented the increase in CD86, MHC-I and MHC-II that would otherwise occur with anti-PD-1 treatment. Conversely, PD-1-deficient Pdcd1-/- TAMs had high rates of glycolysis, phagocytosis, and expression of MHC-II. Myeloid-specific PD-1 deficiency correlated with slower tumor growth, enhanced TAM antigen presentation capability, and increased CD8 T cell activation together with reduced markers of exhaustion. These findings show metabolic signaling and type 1 inflammatory cues in obesity induces PD-1-mediated suppression of TAM function and reveal a unique macrophage-specific and glycolysis-dependent mechanism to modulate immune tumor surveillance and checkpoint blockade. This may contribute to increased cancer risk yet improved response to PD-1 blockade in TAM-enriched tumors and obesity.",GSE242839,2024/07/19,8.3,"[6, 10, 9]","Attempt 1: Score 6 - The dataset explores the role of PD-1 in tumor-associated macrophages within the context of obesity and cancer, revealing mechanisms that could influence immunotherapy outcomes.
