0,200269394,Long-lived central memory gamma delta T cells confer protection against murine cytomegalovirus reinfection,"The involvement of γδ TCR-bearing lymphocytes in immunological memory has gained increasing interest due to their functional duality between adaptive and innate immunity. γδ T effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) subsets have been identified, but their respective roles in memory responses are poorly understood. In the present study, we used subsequent mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections of αβ T cell deficient mice in order to analyze the memory potential of γδ T cells. As for CMV-specific αβ T cells, MCMV induced the accumulation of cytolytic, KLRG1+CX3CR1+ γδ TEM that principally localized in infected organ vasculature. Typifying T cell memory, γδ T cell expansion in organs and blood was higher and more efficient after secondary viral challenge than after primary infection. Viral control upon MCMV reinfection was prevented when masking γδ T-cell receptor, and was associated with a preferential amplification of private and unfocused TCR δ chain repertoire composed of a combination of clonotypes expanded post-primary infection and, more unexpectedly, of novel expanded clonotypes. Finally, long-term-primed γδ TCM cells, but not γδ TEM cells, protected T cell-deficient hosts against MCMV-induced death upon adoptive transfer, probably through their ability to survive and to generate TEM in the recipient host. This better survival potential of TCM cells was confirmed by a detailed scRNASeq analysis of these two γδ T cell subsets which also revealed their similarity to classically adaptive αβ CD8 T cells. Overall, our study uncovered memory properties of long-lived TCM γδ T cells that confer protection in a chronic infection, highlighting the interest of this T cell subset in vaccination approaches.",Mus musculus,GSE269394,2024/07/25,1.8,2,2.0,2.0,"The dataset focuses on γδ T cells and their role in immunological memory, which is somewhat related to immunotherapy.

1,200261624,Gene expression profile of all CD4 T cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes of SPF and Nippostrongylus Brasiliensis infected mice,"The discovery of naïve T cell transcriptional heterogeneity in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice represents a paradigm shift. While the ablation of Vista can alter the proportion of naïve CD4+ T cells with unique transcriptional signatures and the ‘readiness’ of the mice to break tolerance, the effect of non-heritable environmental exposures to commensals or infections remains entirely unknown. This is especially significant since individual variance in immune response, rather than being genetically inherited, is mostly attributed to environmental factors. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional heterogeneity characterizes even the germ-free (GF) mouse naïve CD4+ T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cell transcriptional subsets and their proportions were identical between GF, SPF and conventionalized GF mice, thus commensal-independent. Notwithstanding, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N.b.) infection altered the proportions of these transcriptional subsets, and the appearance of cells with a unique transcriptional signature. These naïve T cell-intrinsic changes accounted for the decreased immunization response of mice to an unrelated antigen. The compositional and functional changes in the naïve CD4+ T cell pool were dependent-variables of helminth infection, regressing with N.b. clearance. Therefore, naïve T cells are not uniformly uncommitted substrates for antigen-dependent activation but actively integrate environmental cues to permute the magnitude of the immune response.",Mus musculus,GSE261624,2024/07/25,1.5,1,1.0,1.0,This dataset examines CD4 T cell responses to a helminth infection but does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy specifically.

During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism.

4,200270084,"Genome-wide Methylation Patterns in Primary Uveal Melanoma: MethylSig-UM, an Epigenomic Prognostic Signature to Improve Patient Stratification","Despite studies highlighting the prognostic utility of DNA methylation in primary uveal melanoma (pUM), it has not been translated into a clinically-useful tool. We sought to define a methylation signature to identify newly diagnosed individuals at high risk for developing metastasis. Methylation profiling was performed on 41 pUM with at least three years of follow-up using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (n=24) and the EPIC BeadChip (n= 17). Findings were validated in the TCGA cohort with known metastatic outcome (n=69). Differentially methylated probes were identified in patients who developed metastasis. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three epigenomic subtypes associated with metastasis. To identify a prognostic signature, recursive feature elimination and random forest models were utilized within repeated cross-validation iterations. The 250 most commonly selected probes compose the final signature, named MethylSig-UM. MethylSig-UM can distinguish individuals with pUM at diagnosis who developed future metastasis with an area under the curve of ~81% in the independent validation cohort, and remains significant in Cox proportional hazard models when combined with clinical features and established genomic biomarkers. Altered expression of immune modulating genes were detected in MethylSig-UM positive tumors, providing clues for pUM resistance to immunotherapy.

5,200239389,Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 inhibits proliferation and metabolism in non–small cell lung cancer cells in HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manner,"Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-α. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway.

6,200272045,Identification of mutant KRAS-related genes associated with malignant phenotypes in NSCLC,"Oncogenic KRAS is found in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we conducted microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that although the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is significantly downregulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho–epidermal growth factor receptor, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment, but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs. Detailed information on the microarray results are available in a previous study (Sunaga N, et al.

Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE270740,2024/07/24,6.7,8,8.0,6.0,"Similar to the previous dataset, this one explores TNF-induced dedifferentiation in melanoma and its relationship with immune checkpoint inhibitors.

20,200246354,GCN2 is a determinant of the response to WEE1 kinase inhibition in small-cell lung cancer,"Patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) are in dire need of more effective therapeutic options. Frequent disruption of the G1 checkpoint in SCLC cells creates a greater dependency of these cells on the G2/M checkpoint to maintain genomic integrity. Indeed, in pre-clinical models, inhibiting the G2/M kinase WEE1 shows promise in inhibiting SCLC growth. However, toxicity and acquired resistance limit the clinical effectiveness of this strategy. Here we conducted CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes influencing the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 kinase inhibition. These screens uncovered a role for the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway in modulating the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 inhibition. Rapid activation of GCN2 upon WEE1 inhibition triggers a stress response. Pharmacological activation of the GCN2 pathway synergizes with WEE1 inhibition. Thus, activation of the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway represents a novel approach for augmenting the efficacy of WEE1 inhibitors in SCLC.",Homo sapiens,GSE246354,2024/07/16,6.7,6,6.0,8.0,"This dataset focuses on small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) and explores the response to WEE1 kinase inhibition, which is relevant to lung cancer therapies.

To address this unmet need, we first comprehensively profiled the epigenomes of metastatic lung tumors finding widespread epigenomic reprogramming during histologic transformation from LUAD to SCLC. We then utilized a novel approach for epigenomic profiling of cell-free DNA, which discriminated patients with EGFR mutant tSCLC from patients with EGFR mutant LUAD with greater than 90% accuracy.

22,200249362,Non-Canonical BAF and mSWI/SNF Regulates POU2F3 and are Selective Targetable Dependencies for POU2F3-Positive Small Cell Lung Cancer,"~12% of SCLCs are marked by the lineage transcription factor POU2F3, which is essential in all POU2F3-positive SCLCs. Thus, approaches to directly or indirectly inhibit POU2F3 could lead to new therapeutic strategies for POU2F3-positive SCLCs. Here we use a positive selection screening strategy where endogenous POU2F3 is fused to the suicide gene DCK*. Cells that express endogenous POU2F3-DCK* are killed in the presence of the nucleoside analog BVdU and only cells that downregulate the POU2F3-DCK* fusion survive. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 resistance screens with BVdU in POU2F3-DCK* cells uncovered that inactivation of SMARCD1 or BRD9, both components of the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex, markedly downregulate endogenous POU2F3. We find that all POU2F3-positive SCLC cell lines relative to ASCL1-positive and NEUROD1-positive cell lines, are exquisitely sensitive to mSWI/SNF complex inhibition using SMARCA2/4 inhibitors; while pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-positive SCLC cell lines are highly sensitive to ncBAF complex inhibition using highly selective BRD9 degraders. Mechanistically, BRD9 binds and regulates POU2F3 target genes including POU2F3 itself. BRD9 degraders or SMARCA2/4 inhibitors robustly decrease accessibility of POU2F3 target genes effectively shutting off POU2F3 function. Moreover, BRD9 degraders or SMARCA2/4 inhibitors decrease tumor growth and increase survival of mice bearing non-neuroendocrine POU2F3 xenografts. This works shows that mSWI/SNF and ncBAF tightly regulate POU2F3 expression and activity and nominate mSWI/SNF or ncBAF inhibition as druggable therapeutic strategies to selectively target POU2F3-positive SCLCs.",Homo sapiens,GSE249362,2024/06/14,7.7,8,7.0,8.0,"This dataset examines POU2F3-positive SCLC and identifies potential therapeutic strategies targeting this transcription factor.

Notably, clinical-grade pharmacologic mSWI/SNF complex inhibition attenuates proliferation of all POU2F3-positive SCLCs, while disruption of ncBAF via BRD9 degradation is uniquely effective in pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-SCLCs. mSWI/SNF complexes maintain accessibility over gene loci central to POU2F3-mediated gene regulatory networks. Finally, chemical targeting of SMARCA4/2 mSWI/SNF ATPases and BRD9 decrease POU2F3-SCLC tumor growth and increase survival in vivo.

30,200269394,Long-lived central memory gamma delta T cells confer protection against murine cytomegalovirus reinfection,"The involvement of γδ TCR-bearing lymphocytes in immunological memory has gained increasing interest due to their functional duality between adaptive and innate immunity. γδ T effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) subsets have been identified, but their respective roles in memory responses are poorly understood. In the present study, we used subsequent mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections of αβ T cell deficient mice in order to analyze the memory potential of γδ T cells. As for CMV-specific αβ T cells, MCMV induced the accumulation of cytolytic, KLRG1+CX3CR1+ γδ TEM that principally localized in infected organ vasculature. Typifying T cell memory, γδ T cell expansion in organs and blood was higher and more efficient after secondary viral challenge than after primary infection. Viral control upon MCMV reinfection was prevented when masking γδ T-cell receptor, and was associated with a preferential amplification of private and unfocused TCR δ chain repertoire composed of a combination of clonotypes expanded post-primary infection and, more unexpectedly, of novel expanded clonotypes. Finally, long-term-primed γδ TCM cells, but not γδ TEM cells, protected T cell-deficient hosts against MCMV-induced death upon adoptive transfer, probably through their ability to survive and to generate TEM in the recipient host. This better survival potential of TCM cells was confirmed by a detailed scRNASeq analysis of these two γδ T cell subsets which also revealed their similarity to classically adaptive αβ CD8 T cells.

While the ablation of Vista can alter the proportion of naïve CD4+ T cells with unique transcriptional signatures and the ‘readiness’ of the mice to break tolerance, the effect of non-heritable environmental exposures to commensals or infections remains entirely unknown. This is especially significant since individual variance in immune response, rather than being genetically inherited, is mostly attributed to environmental factors. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional heterogeneity characterizes even the germ-free (GF) mouse naïve CD4+ T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cell transcriptional subsets and their proportions were identical between GF, SPF and conventionalized GF mice, thus commensal-independent. Notwithstanding, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N.b.) infection altered the proportions of these transcriptional subsets, and the appearance of cells with a unique transcriptional signature. These naïve T cell-intrinsic changes accounted for the decreased immunization response of mice to an unrelated antigen.

34,200241625,Loss of Elp3 impairs the immune response to helminths by blocking intestinal tuft cell differentiation,"Intestinal tuft cells are critical in anti-helminth immunity by producing IL-25, which triggers IL-13 secretion by activated group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in order to ultimately expand both goblet and tuft cells. Translational reprogramming is involved in intestinal tuft cell differentiation but the role of tRNA modifications in this process is unknown. We show here that epithelial Elp3, a tRNA-modifying enzyme, promotes tuft cell differentiation and is consequently critical for IL-25 production, ILC2 activation, goblet cell expansion and control of N. brasiliensis infection in mice. Elp3 is essential for the IL-13-dependent induction of some glycolytic enzymes such as Hexokinase 1 and Aldolase A and consequently links specific metabolic pathways to tuft cell differentiation. Importantly, loss of epithelial Elp3 in the intestine blocks the translation of Nprl2, a mTORC1 inhibitor, which consequently enhances mTORC1 activation and stabilizes Atf4 in both transit amplifying and progenitor cells. Likewise, Atf4 overexpression in mouse intestinal epithelium blocks tuft cell differentiation and impairs the control of intestinal helminth infection. Collectively, our data define Atf4 as a negative regulator of tuft cell differentiation and provide insights into mechanisms through which some tRNA modifications promote a type 2 immune response to parasites in the intestine.",Mus musculus,GSE241625,2024/07/25,2.7,3,2.0,3.0,"This dataset explores tuft cell differentiation in the context of helminth infection, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in a somewhat low relevance score.","This dataset focuses on the role of Elp3 in intestinal tuft cell differentiation and anti-helminth immunity, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

38,200239389,Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 inhibits proliferation and metabolism in non–small cell lung cancer cells in HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manner,"Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-α. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF. Moreover, we performed RNA-seq and transcriptomics analysis to explore the underlying mechanisms, and identified some potential targets and pathways regulated by PHD2, apart from the canonical HIF-mediated hypoxia signaling pathway. These results provide some clues to uncover novel roles of PHD2 in lung cancer progression.",Homo sapiens,GSE239389,2024/07/17,7.8,9,7.0,8.0,"This dataset focuses on PHD2 in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a major subtype of lung cancer.

39,200272045,Identification of mutant KRAS-related genes associated with malignant phenotypes in NSCLC,"Oncogenic KRAS is found in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we conducted microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that although the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is significantly downregulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho–epidermal growth factor receptor, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment, but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs. Detailed information on the microarray results are available in a previous study (Sunaga N, et al. Mol Cancer Ther. 2011;10:336-46).",Homo sapiens,GSE272045,2024/07/16,8.5,9,8.0,9.0,"This dataset investigates KRAS mutations in NSCLC, which is a significant aspect of lung cancer biology.
