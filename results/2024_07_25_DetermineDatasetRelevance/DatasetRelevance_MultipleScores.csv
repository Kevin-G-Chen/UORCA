0,200270741,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [WM35],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE270741,2024/07/24,1.3,2,1,1,"Attempt 1: Score 2 - This dataset focuses on melanoma and its resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is somewhat related to immunotherapy.

2,200271671,Exosomal miR-194 from adipose-derived stem cells impedes hypertrophic scar formation through targeting TGF-β1,"Hypertrophic scars, which result from aberrant fibrosis and disorganized collagen synthesis by skin fibroblasts, emerge due to disrupted wound healing processes. These scars present significant psychosocial and functional challenges to affected individuals. The current treatment limitations largely arise from an incomplete understanding of the underlying mechanisms of hypertrophic scar development. Recent studies, however, have shed light on the potential of exosomal non-coding RNAs interventions to mitigate hypertrophic scar proliferation. This research assesses the impact of exosomes derived from adipose-derived stem cells (ADSCs-Exos) on hypertrophic scar formation using a rabbit ear model. We employed Hematoxylin and Eosin staining, Masson’s Trichrome staining, and Immunohistochemical staining techniques to track scar progression. Our comprehensive analysis encompassed the differential expression of non-coding RNAs, enrichment analyses of functional pathways, protein-protein interaction studies, and miRNA-mRNA interaction investigations. The results reveal a marked alteration in the expression levels of long non-coding RNAs and microRNAs following ADSCs-Exos treatment, with little changes observed in circular RNAs. Notably, miR-194 emerges as a critical regulator within the signaling pathways that govern hypertrophic scar formation. Dual-luciferase assays indicated a significant reduction in the promoter activity of TGF-β1 after miR-194 overexpression. Quantitative reverse transcription PCR and Western blotting assays further validated the decrease in TGF-β1 expression in the treated samples. Moreover, the treatment resulted in diminished levels of inflammatory markers IL-1β, TNF-α, and IL-10. In vivo evidence strongly supports the role of miR-194 in attenuating hypertrophic scar formation through the suppression of TGF-β1. Our findings endorse the strategic use of ADSCs-Exos, particularly through miR-194 modulation, as an effective strategy for reducing scar formation and lowering pro-inflammatory and fibrotic indicators like TGF-β1. Therefore, this study advocates for the targeted application of ADSCs-Exos, with an emphasis on miR-194 modulation, as a promising approach to managing proliferative scarring.",Oryctolagus cuniculus,GSE271671,2024/07/24,0.3,1,0,0,"Attempt 1: Score 1 - The study investigates hypertrophic scars and the role of exosomal miR-194, which is unrelated to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects.

4,200261624,Gene expression profile of all CD4 T cells from the mesenteric lymph nodes of SPF and Nippostrongylus Brasiliensis infected mice,"The discovery of naïve T cell transcriptional heterogeneity in specific-pathogen-free (SPF) mice represents a paradigm shift. While the ablation of Vista can alter the proportion of naïve CD4+ T cells with unique transcriptional signatures and the ‘readiness’ of the mice to break tolerance, the effect of non-heritable environmental exposures to commensals or infections remains entirely unknown. This is especially significant since individual variance in immune response, rather than being genetically inherited, is mostly attributed to environmental factors. Here we demonstrate that transcriptional heterogeneity characterizes even the germ-free (GF) mouse naïve CD4+ T cells. Naïve CD4+ T cell transcriptional subsets and their proportions were identical between GF, SPF and conventionalized GF mice, thus commensal-independent. Notwithstanding, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis (N.b.) infection altered the proportions of these transcriptional subsets, and the appearance of cells with a unique transcriptional signature. These naïve T cell-intrinsic changes accounted for the decreased immunization response of mice to an unrelated antigen. The compositional and functional changes in the naïve CD4+ T cell pool were dependent-variables of helminth infection, regressing with N.b. clearance. Therefore, naïve T cells are not uniformly uncommitted substrates for antigen-dependent activation but actively integrate environmental cues to permute the magnitude of the immune response.",Mus musculus,GSE261624,2024/07/25,0.3,1,0,0,"Attempt 1: Score 1 - This dataset studies CD4 T cells in the context of a specific pathogen, which does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

6,200271086,Personalized dendritic cell vaccine facilitates the preparation of neoantigen-reactive T cells for adoptive transfer (scTCR-Seq),"Adoptive cell transfer (ACT) using neoantigen-specific T cells is an effective immunotherapeutic strategy. However, the difficulty in identifying and screening neoantigen-specific T cells limits its widespread application. Here, we prepared neoantigen-reactive T cells (NRTs) after immunization with a tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccine (OCDC) for ACT. Our results demonstrated that the OCDC vaccine could induce a neoantigen-specific immune response, and it was feasible to prepare NRTs by loading immunogenic neoantigens onto DCs and coculturing them with spleen lymphocytes from mice immunized with the OCDC vaccine. We then transferred these NRTs back to the LL/2 tumor-bearing mice after OCDC vaccine immunization and found that OCDC vaccine and NRTs adoptive transfer combination treatment could induce a stronger antitumor response. Furthermore, we found that infused NRTs could migrate into the tumor microenvironment to exert antitumor effects. Our research provides a new and convenient method of preparing NRTs for ACT.

7,200242951,Contribution of crosstalk of mesothelial and tumoral epithelial cells in pleural metastasis of lung cancer,"Tumor metastasis commonly affects pleura in advanced lung cancer and is related to poor prognosis, but without systematic investigation on different cell types and their crosstalk at single cell resolution. Here, by integrating 180785 single cells from lung cancer and control samples, the most distinctive transcriptome profiles between tumor and control were revealed in mesothelial cells, which is the predominate cell type of pleura. Four subtypes were divided, including one predominately identified in malignant pleural effusion which was characterized by enriched cancer related pathways (e.g., cell migration) along evolutionary trajectory from normal mesothelial cells. Cancer-associated mesothelial cells exhibited varied interactions with different subtypes of malignant epithelial cells, and multiple ligands/receptors exhibited significant correlation with poor prognosis. Experimentally, mesothelial cells can increase the migration ability of lung cancer cells through co-culturing assay, and EGFR was the only affected gene in cancer cells that exhibited interaction with mesothelial cells and was associated with poor prognosis. Using EGFR antagonist cetuximab prevented the increased invasiveness of lung cancer cells induced by mesothelial cells. Moreover, EPGN-EGFR interaction was supported through spatial distribution analysis, revealing the significant proximity between EPGN+ mesothelial cells and EGFR+ epithelial cells.

We sought to define a methylation signature to identify newly diagnosed individuals at high risk for developing metastasis. Methylation profiling was performed on 41 pUM with at least three years of follow-up using the Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation450K BeadChip (n=24) and the EPIC BeadChip (n= 17). Findings were validated in the TCGA cohort with known metastatic outcome (n=69). Differentially methylated probes were identified in patients who developed metastasis. Unsupervised consensus clustering revealed three epigenomic subtypes associated with metastasis. To identify a prognostic signature, recursive feature elimination and random forest models were utilized within repeated cross-validation iterations. The 250 most commonly selected probes compose the final signature, named MethylSig-UM. MethylSig-UM can distinguish individuals with pUM at diagnosis who developed future metastasis with an area under the curve of ~81% in the independent validation cohort, and remains significant in Cox proportional hazard models when combined with clinical features and established genomic biomarkers. Altered expression of immune modulating genes were detected in MethylSig-UM positive tumors, providing clues for pUM resistance to immunotherapy.

9,200261186,Serial Changes of Circulating Tumor Cells in Patients with Hepatocellular Carcinoma Treated with Atezolizumab Plus Bevacizumab,"Background and aims: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have promising outcomes in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC); however, there is no reliable biomarker for predicting disease progression. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) derived from peripheral blood have attracted attention in monitoring therapeutic efficacy. In this study, CTCs were serially collected from patients with HCC undergoing atezolizumab plus bevacizumab (Atezo+Bev) treatment, and changes in molecular expression and CTC numbers were analyzed to identify effective biomarkers. Approach and results: The peripheral blood samples were collected serially from 22 patients with HCC treated with Atezo+Bev, and CTCs were enriched using RosetteSep. The CD45(-)PanCK(+) cell counts were measured using flow cytometry. RNA extracted from enriched CTCs underwent targeted RNA sequencing with next-generation sequencing (NGS) and performed unsupervised hierarchical clustering analysis. Changes in CTC numbers during Atezo+Bev treatment reflected the tumor volume. NGS analysis revealed that patients with elevated transforming growth factor (TGF)-β signaling molecules had a poorer response, whereas those with elevated apoptosis signaling molecules had a favorable response (p < 0.05). In addition, compared with changes in CTC counts, changes in TGF-β signaling molecule expression in CTCs accurately and promptly predicted treatment response. Conclusions: NGS analysis of CTC-derived RNA showed that changes in TGF-β signaling molecules predict treatment response earlier than changes in CTC counts. These findings suggest that changes in the expression of TGF-β molecules in CTCs could serve as novel biomarkers for the early prediction of therapeutic response in patients with unresectable HCC undergoing Atezo+Bev therapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE261186,2024/07/17,0.7,2,0,0,"Attempt 1: Score 2 - This dataset involves hepatocellular carcinoma and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is somewhat related to the query.

We hypothesized that delivering a heterogenous dose of RT would enhance anti-tumor immunity compared to homogenous RT in combination with immune checkpoint blockade (ICI). Using a point source, we delivered a spectrum of dose (~2-32 Gy) to the primary tumor and observed superior systemic immunity in models of metastatic cancer compared to low (2 Gy), moderate (8 Gy), or high (20 Gy) dose homogenous RT. Heterogeneity in RT dose resulted in spatial heterogeneity in gene expression and immune cell infiltration. Moreover, heterogenous RT optimally engaged multiple immune signaling pathways with diverse dose response relationships whereas responses to homogenous RT treatment groups were limited. Single cell RNAseq demonstrated unique enrichment of immune cell populations between each homogenous RT dose group, with several of these dose-dependent changes also represented in the heterogeneously treated tumors, with engagement of both lymphoid and myeloid compartments. This optimized activation of multiple immune mechanisms with distinct dose-dependent profiles within a single tumor may underlie a greater capacity of RT heterogeneity to augment anti-tumor immune response when combined with ICI, as compared to homogenous dose RT.",Mus musculus,GSE234159,2024/07/12,1.3,4,0,0,"Attempt 1: Score 4 - This dataset examines the effects of radiation dose heterogeneity on anti-tumor immunity in the context of immune checkpoint blockade.

16,200269746,Detecting small cell transformation in patients with advanced EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma through epigenomic cfDNA profiling,"Histologic transformation to small cell lung cancer (SCLC) is an increasingly common resistance mechanism to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors in EGFR mutant lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) that is underdiagnosed in clinical practice due to the requirement for tissue biopsy. Early and accurate detection of transformed (t)SCLC has important prognostic and therapeutic implications. To address this unmet need, we first comprehensively profiled the epigenomes of metastatic lung tumors finding widespread epigenomic reprogramming during histologic transformation from LUAD to SCLC. We then utilized a novel approach for epigenomic profiling of cell-free DNA, which discriminated patients with EGFR mutant tSCLC from patients with EGFR mutant LUAD with greater than 90% accuracy. This first demonstration of the ability to accurately, and non-invasively, detect small cell transformation in patients with EGFR mutant LUAD through epigenomic cfDNA profiling is a critical step towards a new paradigm of diagnostic and therapeutic precision for patients with advanced lung cancer.",Homo sapiens,GSE269746,2024/06/20,9.3,9,9,10,"Attempt 1: Score 9 - This dataset focuses on detecting small cell transformation in advanced lung adenocarcinoma, which is highly relevant to lung cancer.

17,200249362,Non-Canonical BAF and mSWI/SNF Regulates POU2F3 and are Selective Targetable Dependencies for POU2F3-Positive Small Cell Lung Cancer,"~12% of SCLCs are marked by the lineage transcription factor POU2F3, which is essential in all POU2F3-positive SCLCs. Thus, approaches to directly or indirectly inhibit POU2F3 could lead to new therapeutic strategies for POU2F3-positive SCLCs. Here we use a positive selection screening strategy where endogenous POU2F3 is fused to the suicide gene DCK*. Cells that express endogenous POU2F3-DCK* are killed in the presence of the nucleoside analog BVdU and only cells that downregulate the POU2F3-DCK* fusion survive. Genome-wide CRISPR/Cas9 resistance screens with BVdU in POU2F3-DCK* cells uncovered that inactivation of SMARCD1 or BRD9, both components of the non-canonical BAF (ncBAF) complex, markedly downregulate endogenous POU2F3. We find that all POU2F3-positive SCLC cell lines relative to ASCL1-positive and NEUROD1-positive cell lines, are exquisitely sensitive to mSWI/SNF complex inhibition using SMARCA2/4 inhibitors; while pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-positive SCLC cell lines are highly sensitive to ncBAF complex inhibition using highly selective BRD9 degraders. Mechanistically, BRD9 binds and regulates POU2F3 target genes including POU2F3 itself. BRD9 degraders or SMARCA2/4 inhibitors robustly decrease accessibility of POU2F3 target genes effectively shutting off POU2F3 function. Moreover, BRD9 degraders or SMARCA2/4 inhibitors decrease tumor growth and increase survival of mice bearing non-neuroendocrine POU2F3 xenografts. This works shows that mSWI/SNF and ncBAF tightly regulate POU2F3 expression and activity and nominate mSWI/SNF or ncBAF inhibition as druggable therapeutic strategies to selectively target POU2F3-positive SCLCs.",Homo sapiens,GSE249362,2024/06/14,8.7,8,9,9,"Attempt 1: Score 8 - This dataset investigates POU2F3-positive small cell lung cancer and its targetable dependencies, which is highly relevant to lung cancer and potential therapeutic strategies.

18,200233097,STAT3 inhibition permits epigenetic reprogramming and TLR9/IRF8-driven differentiation of inv(16) acute myeloid leukemia [RRBS],"Cultured acute myeloid leukemia (AML) blasts can differentiate into antigen-presenting cells but achieving leukemic cell immunogenicity proved challenging in clinical setting. Despite expressing multiple immunostimulatory receptors, such as Toll-like Receptor 9 (TLR9), AML cells resist immunostimulation. We previously demonstrated that eliminating Signal Transducer and Activator of Transcription 1 and 3 (STAT1/3) signaling in AML cells using decoy DNA strategy (CpG-STAT3dODN) synergized with TLR9 stimulation and resulted in T cell-mediated leukemia regression. Here, we interrogated the molecular underpinnings of CpG-STAT3dODN-driven differentiation and immunogenicity of mouse Cbfb/MYH11/Mpl AML. The transcriptional profiling of AML cells isolated from mice after inducible Stat3 silencing plus TLR9 stimulation or CpG-STAT3dODN treatment, revealed comparable upregulation of genes related to myeloid cell differentiation (Irf8, Cebpa) and immune stimulation (Gadd45a, Ciita, Il12a, Ifng) but decreased expression of leukemia-promoting Runx1 and Run1t1. The conditional Irf8 silencing in AML cells almost completely abrogated TLR9-driven leukemia cell differentiation. The AML cell reprogramming by CpG-STAT3dODN was likely regulated epigenetically as revealed by reduced global promoter hypomethylation of crucial myeloid cell differentiation and immune activation genes. These changes were associated with reduced expression of known STAT3 targets, DNMT1 and DNMT3a/b. Finally, we provide initial evidence of anti-leukemic effects of CpG-STAT3 inhibitor against human AML model in humanized mice. Our studies suggest that, beyond oncogenic functions, STAT3 in AML cells may be a primary checkpoint in control of immune-stimulatory and differentiation driving effects. These findings support further development of CpG-STAT3 inhibitors as a new bi-functional agents for AML immunotherapy.",Mus musculus,GSE233097,2024/07/23,0.3,1,0,0,Attempt 1: Score 1 - This dataset focuses on AML and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

19,200270740,Ceramide metabolism alterations contribute to Tumor Necrosis Factor-induced melanoma dedifferentiation and predict resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors in advanced melanoma patients [A375],"Introduction: Advanced cutaneous melanoma is a skin cancer characterized by a poor prognosis and high metastatic potential. During metastatic spread, melanoma cells often undergo dedifferentiation toward an invasive phenotype, resulting in reduced expression of microphthalmia-associated transcription factor (MITF)-dependent melanoma antigens and facilitating immune escape. Tumor Necrosis Factor (TNF) is known to be a key factor in melanoma dedifferentiation. Interestingly, accumulating evidence suggests that TNF may play a role in melanoma progression and resistance to immunotherapies. Additionally, TNF has been identified as a potent regulator of sphingolipid (SL) metabolism, which could contribute to melanoma aggressiveness and the process of melanoma dedifferentiation. Methods: We conducted RNA sequencing and mass spectrometry analyses to investigate TNF-induced dedifferentiation in two melanoma cell lines. In vitro experiments were performed to manipulate sphingolipid metabolism using genetic or pharmacologic alterations in combination with TNF treatment, aiming to elucidate the potential involvement of this metabolism in TNF-induced dedifferentiation. Lastly, to evaluate the clinical significance of our findings, we performed unsupervised analysis of plasma sphingolipid levels in 48 patients receiving treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors, either alone or in combination with anti-TNF therapy. Results: Herein, we demonstrate that TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation is associated with a global modulation of sphingolipid metabolism. Specifically, TNF decreases the expression and activity of acid ceramidase (AC), encoded by the ASAH1 gene, while increasing the expression of glucosylceramide synthase (GCS), encoded by the UGCG gene. Remarkably, knockdown of AC alone via RNA interference is enough to induce melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Furthermore, treatment with Eliglustat, a GCS inhibitor, inhibits TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation. Lastly, analysis of plasma samples from patients treated with immune checkpoint inhibitors, with or without anti-TNF therapy, revealed significant predictive sphingolipids. Notably, the top 8 predictive sphingolipids, including glycosphingolipids, were associated with a poor response to immunotherapy. Discussion: Our study highlights that ceramide metabolism alterations are causally involved in TNF-induced melanoma cell dedifferentiation and suggests that the evolution of specific ceramide metabolites in plasma may be considered as predictive biomarkers of resistance to immunotherapy.",Homo sapiens,GSE270740,2024/07/24,1.3,2,1,1,"Attempt 1: Score 2 - This dataset discusses ceramide metabolism in melanoma and its resistance to immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is somewhat relevant to immunotherapy but not to lung cancer specifically.","Attempt 2: Score 1 - This dataset discusses melanoma and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is somewhat related to immunotherapy, but it does not specifically address lung cancer, making it only minimally relevant.","Attempt 3: Score 1 - This dataset discusses melanoma and immune checkpoint inhibitors, which is somewhat related to immunotherapies but does not specifically address lung cancer.

However, the difficulty in identifying and screening neoantigen-specific T cells limits its widespread application. Here, we prepared neoantigen-reactive T cells (NRTs) after immunization with a tumor lysate-loaded dendritic cell (DC) vaccine (OCDC) for ACT. Our results demonstrated that the OCDC vaccine could induce a neoantigen-specific immune response, and it was feasible to prepare NRTs by loading immunogenic neoantigens onto DCs and coculturing them with spleen lymphocytes from mice immunized with the OCDC vaccine. We then transferred these NRTs back to the LL/2 tumor-bearing mice after OCDC vaccine immunization and found that OCDC vaccine and NRTs adoptive transfer combination treatment could induce a stronger antitumor response. Furthermore, we found that infused NRTs could migrate into the tumor microenvironment to exert antitumor effects. Our research provides a new and convenient method of preparing NRTs for ACT.

21,200241625,Loss of Elp3 impairs the immune response to helminths by blocking intestinal tuft cell differentiation,"Intestinal tuft cells are critical in anti-helminth immunity by producing IL-25, which triggers IL-13 secretion by activated group 2 innate lymphoid cells (ILC2s) in order to ultimately expand both goblet and tuft cells. Translational reprogramming is involved in intestinal tuft cell differentiation but the role of tRNA modifications in this process is unknown. We show here that epithelial Elp3, a tRNA-modifying enzyme, promotes tuft cell differentiation and is consequently critical for IL-25 production, ILC2 activation, goblet cell expansion and control of N. brasiliensis infection in mice. Elp3 is essential for the IL-13-dependent induction of some glycolytic enzymes such as Hexokinase 1 and Aldolase A and consequently links specific metabolic pathways to tuft cell differentiation. Importantly, loss of epithelial Elp3 in the intestine blocks the translation of Nprl2, a mTORC1 inhibitor, which consequently enhances mTORC1 activation and stabilizes Atf4 in both transit amplifying and progenitor cells. Likewise, Atf4 overexpression in mouse intestinal epithelium blocks tuft cell differentiation and impairs the control of intestinal helminth infection. Collectively, our data define Atf4 as a negative regulator of tuft cell differentiation and provide insights into mechanisms through which some tRNA modifications promote a type 2 immune response to parasites in the intestine.",Mus musculus,GSE241625,2024/07/25,1.0,1,1,1,"Attempt 1: Score 1 - This dataset investigates the immune response to helminths and tuft cell differentiation in mice.

22,200249258,Mammalian SWI/SNF complex activity regulates POU2F3 and constitutes a targetable dependency in small cell lung cancer,"Small cell lung cancers (SCLC) are comprised of heterogeneous subtypes marked by lineage-specific transcription factors, including ASCL1, NEUROD1, and POU2F3. POU2F3-positive SCLC, ~12% of all cases, are uniquely dependent on POU2F3 itself; as such, approaches to attenuate POU2F3 expression may represent new therapeutic opportunities for this subtype. Here using genome-scale CRISPR/Cas9-based screens reporting on POU2F3 expression in SCLC cell lines, we define mSWI/SNF complexes, including non-canonical BAF complexes (ncBAF), as top regulators of POU2F3 and dependencies specific to the POU2F3-positive subtype. Notably, clinical-grade pharmacologic mSWI/SNF complex inhibition attenuates proliferation of all POU2F3-positive SCLCs, while disruption of ncBAF via BRD9 degradation is uniquely effective in pure non-neuroendocrine POU2F3-SCLCs. mSWI/SNF complexes maintain accessibility over gene loci central to POU2F3-mediated gene regulatory networks. Finally, chemical targeting of SMARCA4/2 mSWI/SNF ATPases and BRD9 decrease POU2F3-SCLC tumor growth and increase survival in vivo.

25,200269394,Long-lived central memory gamma delta T cells confer protection against murine cytomegalovirus reinfection,"The involvement of γδ TCR-bearing lymphocytes in immunological memory has gained increasing interest due to their functional duality between adaptive and innate immunity. γδ T effector memory (TEM) and central memory (TCM) subsets have been identified, but their respective roles in memory responses are poorly understood. In the present study, we used subsequent mouse cytomegalovirus (MCMV) infections of αβ T cell deficient mice in order to analyze the memory potential of γδ T cells. As for CMV-specific αβ T cells, MCMV induced the accumulation of cytolytic, KLRG1+CX3CR1+ γδ TEM that principally localized in infected organ vasculature. Typifying T cell memory, γδ T cell expansion in organs and blood was higher and more efficient after secondary viral challenge than after primary infection. Viral control upon MCMV reinfection was prevented when masking γδ T-cell receptor, and was associated with a preferential amplification of private and unfocused TCR δ chain repertoire composed of a combination of clonotypes expanded post-primary infection and, more unexpectedly, of novel expanded clonotypes. Finally, long-term-primed γδ TCM cells, but not γδ TEM cells, protected T cell-deficient hosts against MCMV-induced death upon adoptive transfer, probably through their ability to survive and to generate TEM in the recipient host. This better survival potential of TCM cells was confirmed by a detailed scRNASeq analysis of these two γδ T cell subsets which also revealed their similarity to classically adaptive αβ CD8 T cells. Overall, our study uncovered memory properties of long-lived TCM γδ T cells that confer protection in a chronic infection, highlighting the interest of this T cell subset in vaccination approaches.",Mus musculus,GSE269394,2024/07/25,1.0,1,1,1,"Attempt 1: Score 1 - This dataset focuses on γδ T cells and their role in viral infections, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in minimal relevance.","Attempt 2: Score 1 - This dataset focuses on γδ T cells and their role in viral infection, which is not directly related to lung cancer or immunotherapy.

27,200239389,Prolyl hydroxylase domain enzyme PHD2 inhibits proliferation and metabolism in non–small cell lung cancer cells in HIF-dependent and HIF-independent manner,"Prolyl hydroxylase domain protein 2 (PHD2) is one of the intracellular oxygen sensors that mediates proteasomal degradation of hypoxia-inducible factor (HIF)-α via hydroxylation under normoxia. Because of its canonical function in the hypoxia signaling pathway, PHD2 is generally regarded as a tumor suppressor. However, the effects of PHD2 in tumorigenesis are not entirely dependent on HIF-α. Based on the data obtained from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) database, we found that the expression of PHD2 is upregulated in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), which accounts for approximately 80-85% of lung cancers, suggesting that PHD2 may play an important role in NSCLC. However, the function of PHD2 in NSCLC remains largely unknown. In this study, we established PHD2-deficient H1299 cells to investigate the function of PHD2 in NSCLC, and found that PHD2 suppressed cell proliferation and metabolism, but induced ROS levels in human NSCLC cells. Further results indicated that the function of PHD2 in NSCLC is dependent on its enzymatic activity and partially independent of HIF.

Frequent disruption of the G1 checkpoint in SCLC cells creates a greater dependency of these cells on the G2/M checkpoint to maintain genomic integrity. Indeed, in pre-clinical models, inhibiting the G2/M kinase WEE1 shows promise in inhibiting SCLC growth. However, toxicity and acquired resistance limit the clinical effectiveness of this strategy. Here we conducted CRISPR/Cas9 knockout screens to identify genes influencing the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 kinase inhibition. These screens uncovered a role for the GCN2 amino acid-sensing pathway in modulating the response of SCLC cells to WEE1 inhibition. Rapid activation of GCN2 upon WEE1 inhibition triggers a stress response. Pharmacological activation of the GCN2 pathway synergizes with WEE1 inhibition.

30,200272045,Identification of mutant KRAS-related genes associated with malignant phenotypes in NSCLC,"Oncogenic KRAS is found in more than 25% of lung adenocarcinomas, the major histologic subtype of non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), and is an important target for drug development. To this end, we generated four NSCLC lines with stable knockdown selective for oncogenic KRAS. As expected, stable knockdown of oncogenic KRAS led to inhibition of in vitro and in vivo tumor growth in the KRAS-mutant NSCLC cells, but not in NSCLC cells that have wild-type KRAS (but mutant NRAS). Surprisingly, we did not see large-scale induction of cell death and the growth inhibitory effect was not complete. To further understand the ability of NSCLCs to grow despite selective removal of mutant KRAS expression, we conducted microarray expression profiling of NSCLC cell lines with or without mutant KRAS knockdown and isogenic human bronchial epithelial cell lines with and without oncogenic KRAS. We found that although the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway is significantly downregulated after mutant KRAS knockdown, these NSCLCs showed increased levels of phospho-STAT3 and phospho–epidermal growth factor receptor, and variable changes in phospho-Akt. In addition, mutant KRAS knockdown sensitized the NSCLCs to p38 and EGFR inhibitors. Our findings suggest that targeting oncogenic KRAS by itself will not be sufficient treatment, but may offer possibilities of combining anti-KRAS strategies with other targeted drugs.

34,200223266,Intramyocardial Sprouting Tip Cells Specify Coronary Arterialization,"The elaborate patterning of coronary arteries critically supports the high metabolic activity of the beating heart. How coronary endothelial cells coordinate hierarchical vascular remodeling and achieve arteriovenous specification remains largely unknown. Understanding the molecular and cellular cues that pattern coronary arteries is crucial to develop innovative therapeutic strategies that restore functional perfusion within the ischemic heart. Single-cell transcriptomics were used to delineate heterogeneous transcriptional states of the developing and mature coronary endothelium with a focus on sprouting endothelium and arterial cell specification. We discovered that a tip-cell-to-artery specification mechanism drives arterialization of the intramyocardial plexus and endocardial tunnels throughout life. We also identified non-overlapping intramyocardial and subepicardial tip cell populations with differential gene expression profiles and regulatory pathways, suggesting that differential sprouting programs govern the formation and specification of the venous and arterial coronary plexus.",Mus musculus,GSE223266,2024/07/25,1.0,1,1,1,"Attempt 1: Score 1 - This dataset focuses on coronary artery development and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy, resulting in minimal relevance.",Attempt 2: Score 1 - This dataset focuses on coronary artery development and does not relate to lung cancer or immunotherapy.
